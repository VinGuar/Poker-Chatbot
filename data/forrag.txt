DEEP STACK POKER next four dashes:


-Hands that can make the nuts value is increased vs high card or pairs
-preflop play more suited connectors or one gappers slightly and a little less offsuit broadways. 
-4bet a little tighter i think and have bluffs be suited aces, however can defend a little wider vs opens and 3/4bets. Pics back this up.
-IP ev increases a lot when deep stack, huge thing to know


 
How To Play Overpairs
 
SRPs as the Preflop Aggressor
 
I want to start off by looking at the boards where we bet at an extremely high frequency (J72r etc), and then at a relatively high frequency (K65, J42 etc), before moving on to some of the lower/more connected boards (852, 653 etc) where our global frequency will be much lower.
 
J72r BTN vs BB – if we take a look at these boards which are very high frequency cbets (75% and above), we'll see that our KK/QQ are betting always, and then our aces are betting at a very high frequency, but finding a sliver of checks. Our KK/QQ want to bet always, not for protection, but because there is even more value to be had. If we force a cbet on J72, we can see that there are a lot of one pair hands that can call, but so many ace highs in the big blind's range as well. This proves that when we bet KK, it's not so much for protection from the turned overcards, but to get immediate value on the flop from a lot of ace high combos. When we have pocket aces ourselves, we of course block those A highs that will call. That's one small reason for finding a sliver of checks with pocket aces. The other (more important) reason is because if we force the button to check back, we will see a very aggressive, attacking line from the solver in the big blind. Let's look at a 4 of clubs turn, we'll see that the big blind is supposed to lead out here with 45% of its range (and remember, the BB's turn range is the same as their preflop range, so 45% of that range is a LOT of combos). The big blind should stab with so many 4th pairs, 3rd, pairs, top pairs, gut shots, QTo with a club, A5o without a club, and so on. The truth is that a lot of players won't find anywhere near as many of these turn barrels as they should, and vs those more passive players, we will end up missing value on the flop.
 
Summary – vs unknown players, recreational players or weaker regs, on these 'high frequency cbet boards' like Q83r and J72r we want to just go ahead and bet our overpairs always. Vs stronger, more aggressive regulars we want to find a very low frequency check with AA and AA only, as we want to allow them to barrel aggressively on the turn.
 
Q65fd BTN vs BB – here we will see a higher frequency check overall with our range. We will see our KK bet very often, and we'll see a much higher checking frequency with our AA. There are two different reasons for this. Firstly, we now play a lot more checks with our range, and we have a lot of checks with hands like JJ-77 and so on. If our checking range was only these hands, our opponents could make our life a misery on future streets by putting max pressure on that range, so we need to protect that checking range more with our weaker top pairs, and our pocket aces. There is of course a lot of value to be had here by cbetting AA, but on a wetter/more connected single broadway board like this, it's important that we find these medium frequency checks with our aces to protect our wider checking range.
 
A second reason that we want to check a hand like AA here is down to its vulnerability. We're betting AA around 80% of the time on Q72r because of how safe it is to do so, but think of how many bad turns and rivers there are now for our top pairs, and our AA. AA is much stronger on Q72r than it is on Q65fd and as a result we want to play a little more conservatively with these top pairs and AA. You won't be able to bet/bet/jam with AA on Q65fd anywhere near as much as you will on Q72r.
 
There are of course very few overpairs we can have on Q high & J high boards, so let's take a look at some lower/more connected boards and spots some trends for these.
 
Middling T high boards – let's compare how our overpairs play on T94r, 975r and 987fd. The T9x/T8x/98x disconnected boards are traditionally very good for the BTN here (because of the BB's 3b range), so we can clearly see an extremely high betting frequency with our overpairs. Our JJ-KK are always betting, and our AA are finding at a very small frequency. Very similarly to how we play our AA on J72r, we want to determine the type of opponent we are playing against. If we are playing against a rec, an unknown, or a weaker reg, we want to bet our AA here always. If we are playing against a stronger/more aggressive opponent, we want to bet our AA here at a very high frequency, but finding a small amount of checks to allow them to blast the turn will be higher EV for us.
 
Let's take a look now at our 975r texture. Our immediate overpairs (TT/JJ) want to bet always. Earlier we had our KK betting on Q72r to get value from A high, but this time round it is very much for protection purposes. Recognising the difference between getting value from overcards and protecting from overcards will help us to understand the purpose behind our bet. If we force the bet here for BTN, we see the BB folding out so many unsuited combos of KJ, KQ, AJ, AT etc. As our pairs get higher, the need for protection gets less important, and we see a drop off in betting frequency with our KK, and very much so with our AA. Our AA betting the least out of all of our overpairs will be a very common trend throughout this module. In single raised pots with a very high SPR and wider ranges, AA becomes a lot more passive on wetter/more connected textures due to its vulnerability.
 
Let's now take a look at a very low/connected texture like 653fd. We now see a very sharp shift in our strategy. Our immediate overpairs are still betting virtually always, mainly for protection, but also because a hand like 77/88/99 block a lot of the BB's high equity draws like 97s etc. Our pocket pairs ladder up in their checking frequency here, so our immediate overpairs like 77-99 bet always, then TT-QQ bet at a medium frequency, our KK bets quite infrequently, and as always our AA bets the least. We can look at a variety of these low/connected textures to see that the trend is very clear.
 
I want to finish off this section by looking at a low board that is disconnected. If we look at 832r or 742r, we can clearly see a return to our extremely high betting frequency with our overpairs. If we look at 832fd we can see that our frequencies drop ever so slightly, but we are still betting at a much higher frequency than a board like 653fd. These lead me nicely into the summary for this second part of this first section...
 
Summary – we still want to bet extremely often with our overpairs on these lower disconnected boards, whether they are T high or 7 high. As the board gets more middling/connected, we see our immediate overpairs still betting virtually always, and our checking frequencies ladder up the higher our pair is. On the very low/connected boards, we still see our immediate overpairs betting always (for protection purposes), and again we ladder up to the point where our QQ/KK are betting very infrequently, and our AA is betting virtually never.
 
AA is our overpair that checks the most. This is because it needs no protection, it strengthens our checking range, and we want to allow our opponent to lead on the turn aggressively into a very strong hand of ours. Our AA is so rarely going to be a 3-street-for-value hand on a board like 642fd, so we want to start out with a check very often!


 
How To Play Overpairs
 
SRPs as the Preflop Caller
 
We are going to change the topic of the module slightly for this subsection. Not only will we look at our overpairs, but we will include our top pairs in this section as well. I want to break this part of the module down into 2 different sections...
 
BB vs BTN – we are of course not going to look at any A high – 9 high flops because we don't have any overpairs on these boards. We can check our preflop charts to see that we always 3b TT+ preflop, our 9s are mainly a 3b, our 8s are a mix, and then 7s – 2s are virtually always a call preflop.
 
742r – let's start by talking a look at how our top pairs play on a board like this. We will see very few raises with our middling top pairs (Q7 – 87), and naturally our strongest top pairs will be raising at a much higher frequency. Our A7 is more inclined to raise because it can get value from hands like J7, T7 etc. We also want to be raising our top pairs with very low kickers on this texture with backdoor draws. The reason for this is that 1) they have backdoor equity in the form of straight/flush draws, and 2) if we force the BB to raise we can see that the BTN is supposed to continue in some form with high-card hands like J9s, but not J5s. So when we have 75s ourselves, we unblock the J highs that have to continue that are doing very poorly vs us. If we have 97s however we block these hands. If we change the board to T53, we can see that we raise our strongest top pairs, and again we raise some of our T6s type hands with a BDFD/BDSD. If we look a little further at a board like K53, we see that the trend of raising our weakest top pairs no longer applies, but we find some KJ-K9s with a BDFD.
 
It's also very important to mention that we will face a variety of cbet sizes on these low textures. Our raising range will be very similar whether we face a 33%, 50%, 75%, 100% or 133% cbet, we simply raise more often vs the smaller bets, and much less often vs the larger bets. This relates to all parts of the game tree, not just this topic; when we face larger bets, we raise/call less frequently. When we face smaller bets, we raise/call more often. The two ranges will be very very similar, it's just the frequency that changes!
 
Summary – on these low rainbow boards, we want to raise our top pairs with the strongest kicker, our middling top pairs are always calls, and we also want to raise our top pairs with “under-kickers” to the top card when they have a BDSD/BDFD. This trend of raising our weakest top pairs with backdoor equity does not apply when the board is K63 etc.
 
6h4s2h – we are once again playing this board very aggressively overall, check raising around 17% of the time. If we look first at our strongest top pairs, they are still raising, but at a lower frequency than on 732r. This is because our TPTK type hands are more vulnerable on 642fd and therefore we are less inclined to fastplay and bloat the pot with a hand that can easily fall behind on more turn cards. Again, we are really favouring backdoor equity, our A6ss/K6ss raising more often than the cc/dd combos. We can also see a very high raise frequency with our 65s/63s combos. These are our weakest top pairs but again are high equity hands with good unblockers.
 
Taking a look at our overpairs, we can again see that we want to raise these at a relatively high frequency, and we prioritise having a BDFD in our hand as opposed to not having a BDFD in our hand. I want to quickly address a common misconception about this spot. A lot of people think that we don't want to have a BDFD here, as we want to unblock the flush draw combos we are getting value from. This is a BTN vs BB SRP, ranges are unbelievably wide, so having 77 with a BDFD means you block a tiny portion of the flush draws that the BTN has. There are some other (tighter range) scenarios in the game tree where this is the other way round, but for these wide range spots you want to prioritise having backdoor equity yourself/blocking your opponent's higher equity hands.
 
 
 
BB vs MP
 
742r – let's start off by taking a look at our top pairs, we'll see a very consistent trend of our weakest top pairs with nice backdoor continuing to raise at a medium frequency. We now see very few raises with our semi-strong top pairs, and our TPTK is still getting raised at the highest frequency of all our top pairs, but still not that often in the grand scheme of things. I want to quickly compare our top pairs on 742r with something similar like J52r. We again see that there is very little raising here with any top pairs. We can look at a couple of different textures here to see that the trend is very clear: we do much less raising BB vs MP with top pairs/overpairs than we do BB vs BTN. This is down to how much wider the BTN's range is, and of course how much narrower MP's range is. It's important we still find these low kicker top pairs on the lower boards, but we must be MUCH more call heavy with our top pairs on 9 high – A high boards.
 
On a board like Q52cds, the solver finds a little sliver of x/r with hands like Q4/Q3 with a BDFD, around 20% or so of the time. MP is supposed to cbet, and then float your x/r with hands like JT, 87, etc. Humans will not find these floats, particularly at lower stakes, and therefore their continuing range gets stronger, so we want to reconsider raising these really low top pairs here and strengthen our own range to counteract this. It's also important to note that if our opponent isn't floating with J high as much as they should on Q74, we want to be aggressive with our K6 bdfd, A3 bdfd, 85s etc.
 
Let's now take a look at how our overpairs want to play on 742r. As we can see, we are now doing MUCH less raising with all of our overpairs. .
 
642fd – let's finish off by quickly looking at our value raising range on this lower/more connected flop. We can clearly see that it is very similar to 742r. We want to raise A6 at a reasonable frequency, and then everything else is a call until we get down to our top pairs that also have a straight draw. Our overpairs are still raising really quite infrequently overall, and as mentioned we like to prioritise having a BDFD or unblocking the BDFD.
 
We need to be more selective with our TP/overpair raising range when we are MP vs BB compared to when we are BTN vs BB. This is down to MP's raising range becoming a lot narrower (and in actual fact the BB's range becoming wider – the BB calls more vs MP than it does vs BTN), and as a result we can't raise as liberally with top pairs and overpairs!


How To Play Overpairs


3BPs As Preflop Aggressor IP




For this section we will start off by taking a look at BTN vs CO. We are generally betting so much on A high – J high boards that we can comfortably skip these and look at middling/low textures.


953r/953fd – the first thing I want to talk about is the difference in size and frequency on a rainbow texture compared to a FD texture. Using the same board will best demonstrate the point I want to make. As we can see, our betting frequency increases slightly on the rainbow texture, and there is also slightly more weight in the larger sizes on a rainbow texture. We tend to play the rainbow textures more aggressively because there will be less higher equity hands in our opponent's range, and we want to bet wider and use bigger sizes. Another way of saying this is that we want to play the flush draw boards more passively because our opponent will have higher equity hands and our range wants to play more conservatively.


On 953r we will see that all of our overpairs are betting virtually always, and our AA /KK find a little sliver of checking back. If we look at 953fd we will see much more checking back with those overpairs. As mentioned above we prefer to play a little more conservatively with our range on FD boards because of how much the board can change. On 953 with two clubs and one diamond, the solver likes to have a club for backdoor equity purposes, but it also really doesn't like to have a diamond, blocking those marginal backdoor equity floats. Note that the solver gets a little erratic here when choosing what combos to bet changing whether it has TT or JJ or QQ or KK. We want to keep our strategy simple here and prioritise having a BDFD, and if possible unblocking the KQdd BDFD type hands ourselves.


632r – I want to take a look now at a much lower, much more connected board. We are used to seeing a bit of a ladder effect with our pocket pairs, with our immediate overpairs betting the most, and then our checking frequency laddering up so that our highest pocket pairs do the most checking. We are going to see more of a “half moon effect” with our pocket pairs here on this very low texture. Our immediate overpairs are actually going to do a lot of checking, and then our middling pocket pairs are going to do a lot more betting, and then the highest pairs in our range are going to be mostly checking.


Our TT-QQ betting region is understandable; they are strong hands, they can get called by a lot of worse hands, and the lower region (TT, maybe JJ as well) benefit from a little bit of protection.


Our KK/AA combos starting to check more (with AA checking more often than KK) are understandable; they block the weak “non pair” portion of our opponent's range that will call, they need a lot less/no protection from overcards, and they help us keep our range balanced for when we have to check our weaker hands.


Our 77-99 checking frequency will be a new concept to so many people watching this module. You'd be forgiven for thinking that 77 needs a lot of protection, and therefore wants to bet. If we force the BTN to bet here, we will see that 77 won't get called by enough worse combos, and truth be told, the combos of worse hands that call, are all still doing really quite well. 65 suited, 44, all these types of hands are of course weaker than 77, but they still have a lot of equity when called. When you combine these weaker hands having high equity with the fact that CO still has 88-JJ, and then factor in the flopped sets that we don't have, it's not as appealing to bet our pocket 7s as we may have initially thought. It's like betting AQs with a BDFD here. You're not getting called by enough worse hands, you're not getting any better hands to fold, your are isolating yourself vs a much stronger range when you bet, and therefore your hand prefers to pot control in position instead of betting. It does bet at a very small frequency, because of course there are some worse hands (like AJ/AT suited with a BDFD) that can call. We can use this exact flop when looking at MP vs UTG to see the same logic applies, and we will see a lot of checks with these marginal overpairs once more, with the “half moon effect” coming into play with our pocket pairs.


Coming back to BTN vs CO, there are two more boards I want to take a quick look at. If we look at 643r we will see our 77 bet virtually always. This is of course because we have a gutshot, which gives us a lot more equity and allows us to bet our hand. We can clearly see our 88 checking a lot more, and then our 99/TT starting to bet a decent amount. If we were to look at 764r we will see our 88 betting always, and then our 99/TT checking a bit. Lastly if we look at one more disconnected board like 742r, we will see our 88/99 reverting to checking quite often.


We aren't just relentlessly betting our weaker/more vulnerable overpairs in 3BPs; our lowest pairs are doing a decent amount of checking because they will run into stronger hands too often when they always bet. The exception to this is when our immediate overpair has a gutshot (88 on 754 bets always). The middling/higher pocket pairs like 99-QQ on 852 will bet the most, and the we see the top of the “half moon effect” with our KK checking more, and our AA checking a little more than that!


 
How To Play Overpairs
 
3BPs As Preflop Caller OOP
 
We're going to pick up immediately where we left off in the previous section (3BPs as preflop aggressor IP), and simply mirror the situation. We'll stick with BTN vs CO, and we'll look at how the OOP player wants to play on these textures vs a cbet.
 
952r – as we can clearly see, we are supposed to play an aggressive check/raise strategy with our overpairs here. Our TT raising around half the time, and our JJ always. If we look at our top pairs, we'll also see A9 raising a similar frequency to our TT. This is somewhat expected because TT/JJ are quite high pocket pairs, and they'll be quite strong on a variety of boards, and will be able to be called by enough worse hands to justify raising (we have spoken about the threshold in the previous parts of this module). Let's switch now to a lower flop, and see how our overpairs are playing there.
 
742r – on this lower texture, we can see that our immediate overpairs like 88-TT are playing much more passively, raising very infrequently, and our JJ is playing the most check/raises. Our TT raises less frequently here because there are less top pairs to get value from (on 952r we can x/r TT because it gets called by J9, Q9 etc, but on 742r our TT can't get called by Q7, J7, T7 because they are not in the BTN's 3b range). There is also a clear preference as to which combos of pocket pairs we prefer to raise. Whilst we raise all combos of TT at some frequency on 8h 5c 2d, we can see that the TT with a spade is preferred. This is because we are trying to get value from hands like AT/KT/QT with a BDFD, and if we have TT with a spade, it's more likely our opponent has one of those combos – we unblock the overcards with a BDFD a little more. Think about how little equity KJs has when you have JJ, and therefore you want to give yourself the best chance of your opponent having that KJs combo.
 
6c4c2d – we have looked at which of our overpairs want to raise, raise more than others, call, and so on, but there's a part of this module that we need to dedicate to folding. A strategy that will likely be completely new to people is calling a 3bet, and just check/folding an overpair out of position. If we look at this flop and force a large cbet for the IP player, we can see that OOP is supposed to fold 77 and 88 without a BDFD. We call 99 without a BDFD, but it is a marginal call at that. If we are to force the BTN to cbet 50%, we will see that even hands like 88/99 without a diamond are very marginal.
 
The example above is a wide range vs wide range scenario. If we change the scenario so that it is CO vs UTG and use a flop like 6s 4d 2s, we can see that a similar trend applies. Our 77-99 without a spade are mainly folding.
 
The reason for this is because the IP player is supposed to be cbetting quite infrequently overall on these lower/wetter textures, and as a result when they do cbet, their range gets stronger. It is stronger hands + high equity hands, and therefore our marginal middling pairs with no BDFD shrivel up and become really quite weak.


How To Play Overpairs


3BPs As Preflop Aggressor OOP


732r – I have purposefully chosen this board texture to highlight a difference between how we play our immediate overpairs OOP compared to when we're IP. In the previous section of this module we saw our 88/99 playing more passively than we might have thought on a board like this. This was because when we broke down the CO's range, our 88 wasn't getting called by enough worse combos/wasn't doing that well vs the CO's continuing range. If we look at the SB's strategy here vs the BTN on this board, we can see that our 88 is the pocket pair that bets the most. This is because, now, our 88 can get called by a lot more worse combos. When the BTN 3bets, the CO calls approx 110 combos. When the SB 3bets, the BTN calls approx 200 combos! This means that our 88 here doesn't need to worry about not getting called by enough worse hands. We can browse the sim to see that there are plenty of worse hands that continue here. The ladder effect very much comes into play here, our 88 bets the most, our 99 a tiny bit less, and so on. As is standard with a lot of what we've seen in this module, our AA is used to protect our range and is used as a high frequency check.


Let's take a look and see how we are supposed to play after we check and the BTN stabs for a small size. We can see that every single pair from 88-QQ is check/raising virtually 100% of the time. We are supposed to play extremely aggressively here with our overpairs in the form of a cbet, or a virtually pure check/raise with those mentioned combos. It's important that we find this aggression on these low/disconnected flops.


We are supposed to do a lot of check/calling with AA here. This is because our opponent, as seen, is supposed to absolutely blast off into us with Q high, K high, J high etc type hands. It's really important that we determine the type of player we are playing against and adjust our strategy accordingly. Weaker/more passive players will not bluff as much as they should, and therefore we cost ourselves EV by trapping them. Let's go ahead and x/c vs the more aggressive players who we think will find these non equity bluffs.


853fd – if we look at something a little wetter/more connected, we will see a very similar strategy here. We are cbetting a little less frequently with all of our pocket pairs, but when we do check them, we are playing a high check/raise strategy again. We can look at the specific combos that want to check/raise, and we can see that a backdoor flush draw is very much preferred. You might think that you want to unblock the flush draw so you can get value from them, but flush draws are high equity hands and we prefer to block our opponent's high equity hands + have a little extra backdoor equity ourselves.


Let's take a step back from focusing on overpairs for a moment and talk about how our overall range wants to play in this scenario. We will find that our cbet frequency is obviously the highest on boards that are very good for us (K83r etc). As the board gets lower, our frequency decreases. The “not so great” boards for us (we will say 8 high and below) can be cut into two sections: disconnected and connected.


On a disconnected board like 732r, our global frequency is 45%. We're still betting this board a reasonable amount overall. On an extremely wet connected board like 654fd, our global frequency is 12%. If we look at something in the middle like 753fd, we can see a global frequency of 35%. The wetter/more connected the board, the less frequently we cbet in this spot.


The reason we have zoomed out and looked at how our range wants to play is because we can now take this knowledge and zoom back in and look at how specific parts of our range want to play. Armed with the knowledge that we bet less frequently on wetter/connected boards, we can define our strategy more clearly.


On 732r, our 88-JJ bet virtually always. Our QQ/KK bet 50% of the time. Our AA bets around 25%.
On 753fd, our 88-JJ bet less frequently than above, but still very often and our QQ/KK/AA slightly less as well.
On 654fd, our 77-QQ bet very infrequently, and our KK/AA virtually never.


On all three examples, if we are checking, we are finding a very aggressive check/raise strategy on all the flops, but the wetter/more connected the board, the less we check/raise overall, whilst still maintaining a relatively high check/raise frequency.


 
How To Play Overpairs
 
3BPs As Preflop Caller IP
 
We are going to continue with our SB vs BTN scenario here, and before we get into specific boards, I want to talk about the difference in our raising strategy on a variety of textures with our entire range. Let's compare how we play vs a large cbet on the following boards...
 
952r / 952fd
743r / 743fd
862r / 862fd
 
...as we can clearly see, we are playing small raises vs the large bet size on rainbow textures, and we are shoving vs a cbet on the flush draw textures. This is a very consistent trend and one that we must apply to our strategy.
 
It's really important to note that the shoving strategy is applied when we face a large cbet (75% pot or above). If we face a cbet of 50% or so (which will be standard in some spots), we revert back to playing smaller raises.
 
Let's talk about why that is. Normally when we are constructing our range, we build our strategy around our valuebets, and add our bluffs from there. In this spot, however, we are building our strategy around our bluffs. We have some very natural bluffs on 752fd that, when facing a large bet, low SPR etc, they are happy to just go ahead and shove with their equity. On 752r, however, none of our bluffs want to shove. The solver doesn't want to just shovel money in with a minimal equity bluff vs that large bet, so it prefers to use smaller raises. We don't want to just shove all in with minimal equity!
 
Let's delve into some of these textures now and analyse how our range wants to play. Instead of zoning in on two or three specific boards, let's simply pick a couple of rainbow textures at random, and a couple of flush draw textures, and look for consistencies within the solver.
 
Rainbow – our raising range is very narrow here, and it's easy to work out what it is. When you have a raising range of 4% or 5%, it's going to be quite ABC and easy to work out. When you have raising ranges of 25% (as is standard in a lot of SRPs), it becomes a bit more complex with some unorthodox combos. If the board is 7 high, we raise our 88-TT. If the board is 8 high, we raise our 99/TT. If the board is 9 high, we are raising our TT, and a little sliver of JJ. The question is, why are we raising these 88-TT combos, but not our JJ/QQ (note QQ rarely flats preflop vs a 3b, but it is in there a little)? There are two reasons. The first one is fairly obvious, we get a little bit of protection. The second reason is that, if we look at a board like 852r for example, when we raise the SB's cbet, the SB is supposed to bet/call with hands like KJs, QJs, AJs, and a few other combos. The SB is not supposed to bet/call with hands like J9s or T9s on this texture. You'll notice that the frequencies that the SB bet/calls with these Q high overcard/BDFD type hands are sensitive and change on a variety of boards, but there are a few floats in there on all the low boards (some more than others) that we want to unblock.
 
Our overall range is not particularly wide in this spot. Let's take a brief look at some of the weaker hands that accompany our defined overpair range. If we look at 742hdc, we will see that we want to have some A8s with a BDFD, and some A5s as well. Interestingly enough when we have A8s we want the BDFD, but when we have A5s the combo that raises the most is without the BDFD. The reason for this is that A8 is a hand that cannot improve to a really strong hand on the turn, so backdoor equity is preferred. A5s, however, has a gutshot, so we can raise all combos.
 
Flush draw – I want to quickly re-iterate the point that we do not play jams vs 50% bet sizes, this is reserved for larger bet sizes. We can use 7d 5d 2c as a great example to illustrate that point. Interestingly enough, if we look at our overpairs here, they want to shove without a diamond in their hand. We've seen a lot of examples throughout this module where the solver likes to have that additional backdoor equity/would prefer to block our opponent's higher equity hands, but when it comes to playing for all the chips, the solver prefers for our opponent to have hands like flush draws in their range. If our opponent bets a large size here and we shove, our opponent's calling range is pocket pairs and flush draws. If we block those flush draws, then it's more likely our opponent has a pocket pair, so we want to allow our opponent to call it off for all the chips with hands like flush draws, and not just strong hands.
 
Let's take a little look at a few different lower boards to see that the solver is consistent with the types of hands (JJ/TT/certain flush draws) that want to move all in.


What is the range advantage?
 
There are a few different ways to explain what a range advantage is. Simply put, it is whichever players’ range has greater equity at that moment in the hand has the range advantage. The equity that your range has (and therefore who has the range advantage) will shift throughout the entirety of the hand based on a variety of factors. A lot of people simply look at the flop and determine who has the equity advantage, but it’s really important to remember that the equities will change throughout the hand, which in turn dictates what we can and can’t do, so it is a very good habit to get into in terms of thinking about who has the equity advantage throughout the whole hand, and not just on the flop.
 
For example, BTN opens, BB defends, the flop is K74fd. The button’s range has 53.46% equity. When the BTN cbets for 33%, it increases to 54.29%. When the BB calls, however, the BTN’s equity drops all the way down to 46.88%. If the BB had decided to raise the flop, the BTN’s equity drops even further to 44.92%, but when the BTN calls the x/r, the equity jumps back up to 53.98%. This is a very quick but very cool example of how the equities change so drastically with just a few clicks.
 
Why is this important? Let’s look at another example. BTN opens, BB defends, the flop is 862fd. The BB has 45.93% equity, and when the BTN cbets for 70% and the BB calls, the BB’s equity skyrockets to 53.08%, and if we see the six of clubs on the turn, we can see that the BB’s equity then jumps to 56.65%. That is a huge shift in equity, and understanding what actions and/or what turn/river cards dictate the shift in equities can give a really nice insight into how that affects our strategy.
 
What is the nut advantage?
 
Put simply, the nut advantage lies with the player that contains more nutted combos in their range. Whilst the range advantage dictates our strategy, it’s not the be-all-and-end-all when it comes to deciding what action to take, and the nut advantage can have a significant impact on our strategy. Taking the time to think about which player has more nutted combos in their range can help you determine things like how often you can/can’t bet, when you can lead out, and when you are forced to check your entire range.
 
For example, EP opens, the BB defends, the flop is T97r. EP’s range has a significant equity advantage here of 54.8%, however we can see that, when checked to, EP has to check back here around 60% of the time. This is because the BB has a slight nutted advantage on this board. Both players have TT, 99 & 77 on this board at very similar frequencies, but BB has J8s and 86s always, whereas EP doesn’t have these combos.
 
If we take this concept one step further and look at 653r in the same scenario, we can see that the equities of the two ranges are virtually identical, but the BB’s nut advantage is so strong that two things happen: 1) the BB gets to lead out very often here for a small size, and 2) if the BB were to play no leads on this board (and therefore being completely uncapped), the BB’s lack of nutted hands (factored in with so many bad turn cards) force the BB to check back its entire range on the flop.
 
These two concepts are both equally important on their own, and often go hand in hand when determining our strategy. Throughout the remainder of this module we will go into more detail about both of them and really focus on how they determine our strategy.


Shifting Range & Nut Advantages




As we have seen, almost every action that we take will change the equity each player has in the hand. If we quickly refresh ourselves, we can see that on A82r BTN vs BB, the BTN's equity is jumping up and down based on every action. Understanding the shift in range advantage gives a key insight into our strategy, and how it is affected. For example, if we cbet on A82r, when the BTN calls, our equity is <50% on basically every turn, and therefore our turn barrelling strategy is polarized, and the range that we get to bet is very particular.


On the flipside, if we look at SB vs BTN 3bet pot on 742r, if the SB cbets the flop, we can see that they get to barrel really wide on a variety of turns. This is because those turns are good for the SB, they retain the equity advantage, and therefore they get to be much more liberal with their betting range. It's very important that we understand the difference between the two scenarios, and that we get into the habit of thinking about which actions and runouts give us more or less equity. For example, in example one when we cbet the flop our equity falls drastically, but if we check back on the flop, we still retain an equity advantage on all of the turn cards! As a quick sidenote, it's very cool to see that on A834 we are using a small delay cbet size, and on A83Q we are using a huge size. This is for the exact same reason that we use a big cbet size on AQ4 in SRPs; the pot is small and the solver wants to bloat it very quickly with that nut advantage (we have a nut advantage on A83Q but not so much on A834).


Summary – the equity will change significantly based on actions and runouts, it's important that we are thinking about the changes/retention in equity as it significantly alters our strategy!


Let's take a look now at shifts in nut advantage. As we have already seen, the nut advantage changes our strategy and allows us to lead out in certain scenarios, even if we do not hold the equity advantage. This will also very much apply when we arrive to the turn.


Before we look, it's important to note that we've already seen many examples in this module of us having a significant equity disadvantage and a significant nut advantage.


SRPs – let's take a look at 953fd when MP opens and BB defends. If we force MP to cbet here and BB to call, we can see that BB is supposed to lead out so often on so many low/middling turn cards. Our leading strategy is so significant that if we are not implementing it, we are costing ourselves a reasonable amount of EV.  Let's take a look at how much the nut advantage changes on some different turns. On the flop, the nut advantage is somewhat neutral, but on the 6x turn the nut advantage shoots up for the BB. Far more turned straights and turned two pair in BB's range means that the BB should be finding a lot of leads here. When you add in the fact that we already know about the cbettor's equity decreasing because they retain their airballs and the BB's range becomes condensed, it all adds up to one thing – the BB's range can very much justify check/calling on the flop and leading out on the turn.


Let's take a look now at board pairing turns. For this example, we will use BTN vs BB. The first board we will look at is Q76fd. If we force the BTN to cbet, we can see that when the BB calls they want to lead out on every single paired turn card, even the queen at a low freqeuency! If we look at the ranges tab for the 7x turn we can see way more trips combos in the BB's range. We are leading a decent amount here on the 7x and 6x turns, but not as much as we've seen in some other examples where we have the nut advantage. Understanding why that is is very important; the BTN's cbet strategy contains a lot of 7x and 6x. Let's change the board now to 853fd. Before we look at the turn cards we want to be leading on, let's look at the breakdown of BTN's cbetting range, we can clearly see that there are not that many combos of 5x and 3x. This means that when the BTN does cbet on this board, and the BB calls, the BB's turned trips advantage (or turned straight/2p advantage on 6x turns etc) is so significant that they get to lead MUCH wider on the 5x and 3x turns than on the Q76 example.




3BPs – let's first of all look at a narrow range vs narrow range scenario with UTG vs MP on 872r. Firstly let's look at the paired turns. We'll see that we're just never leading on any board pairing turns, and that may be obvious to some of us, but it's really important that we understand why we don't want to lead here, compared to the many SRP examples we have seen so far. In SRPs we have so many more combos that defend preflop, so on 8728 we have 86s, 85s, K8o, A8o etc, but in a 3bp we have very few 8x combos. There are some turns that we do lead, and these are very clear. Let's investigate the 9x turn, we can clearly see that UTG has way more two pair and straight combos, and therefore a significant nut advantage, and gets to lead out with its entire range here. Our equity is very good on the 3x turn but we never lead, proving that the nut advantage is the reason we get to lead out so much here. We can look at some boards like A84r and K63fd to see that leading is just so rare on any turn cards because we won't have a significant nut advantage, but on these middling boards with lots of turned straights/turned sets that our opponent doesn't have, our range can very much support leading out at a huge frequency.


We can change the scenario to CO vs BTN with wider ranges to see that the above still applies. If we look at a board like 864r, the turns that we get to lead should now be really quite obvious to us. Given the extremity of our nut advantage, our frequency on the turns we want to lead here is basically 100%.


We can also look at some less obvious scenarios now. Let's look at A53r BTN vs CO, after BTN cbets, we can see that there are some turns that the CO gets to lead on. Again, if we really think about the turns that give the CO the nut advantage, our leading strategy should become quite obvious. If we break down both players' ranges on a 2 or a 4 turn we can see that shift in nut advantage, compared to the breakdown on a T turn for example.


If we look at one more board in this scenario, K65r, again BTN cbets and CO calls. There is only one turn card that we want to lead on here, and it's the 7. You might think that we want to lead on a 4 as well, but the difference here is that we fold 44 on the flop, but call 77. Our leading strategy changes drastically over a such a small detail, which means it's really important that we are focused and thinking about all of the intricate details, because one small mistake in our thought process could mean we are leading in spots that we shouldn't be.


I want to look at one final scenario here, UTG vs CO 3BP. If we again use our A53r example, we will still see leads on the 4x and the 2x. This tells us that even when our range is narrow, we still find these leads because of our nut advantage. There's one last thing that allows us to lead, and that is the fact that the CO still has so much air in their range (because they get to cbet KQo and KTs) and our range is condensed (because we fold these hands), that our range becomes stronger + we now have the nut advantage = our range can support these leads.




-play tighter multiway, however most dont
-some people just dont adjust in multiway versus headsup
-we want to bet with more equity, which means stronger value hands and stronger bluffs versus headsup. Way way less pure bluffs bc so likely someone got a piece. Theres just way more defense when facing more people
-ranges be tighter value betting, bluffing, check raising, calling, etc.








Video notes:
 


(0:00) Introduction to BTN vs SB vs BB on 985ss:
* (0:00) Looking at the BTN vs SB vs BB solution, it’s important to remember that although a GTO villain will 3-bet much more often than call in the SB, when playing live you will often face calls in the SB, so you have to be able to adjust and play against this strategy. 
* (1:10) On 985ss the BTN has a lot of incentive to check behind and not c-bet since the board is so dynamic and even overpairs are likely going to get weaker on later streets and will have to check eventually. The flop is a decent street to check back in position, and we can still get 2 streets on the turn and river. 
* (2:10) Since BTN will check back so often on 983ss, developing a leading range in the blinds is important. We should have fewer leads in the SB however because it’s a worse position than the BB. We’ll probably be leading 2-3 times as much from the BB as from the SB since we are in middle position.
 
 (3:50) Preflop Ranges and Presets for BTN vs SB vs BB on 985ss:  
* (6:00) Adjust your strategy based on your opponent’s tendencies. A lot of opponents won’t be calling hands like 95s and 85s in the BB, so their range will have less two pairs and be less strong on this board. Always be thinking about how the different parts of the game tree affect future parts. 
* (7:30) If people are playing pretty nitty postflop, they’re probably playing nitty preflop too. 
* (9:00) In multiway pots hands that have better playability are much better. You will value having suited hands even more now, and suited connectors are really strong.
* (16:40) Even though overall BTN has more equity, BB and SB have more high equity holdings.
* (24:30) As humans, we want simple solutions for complex ideas. The solver provides those complex ideas, now we have to simplify them and make them implementable. 
* (28:00) Be careful with your bluffing frequencies when playing against players that you play with all the time. If you start over-bluffing a ton you will get caught pretty fast, if you are playing with people who actually pay attention. However, if you are playing in a one off tourney or cash game, you can get away with massive exploitation. 
 
(31:30) SB lead on 985ss:
* (32:30) We lead 55 with a spade less often than without a spade on the flop. This is because we need less protection when we have the spade, so we can check more often because we can have some backdoor flushes (albeit weak ones). However, when we look at JJ and TT we are betting more often with a spade. This is because these hands are much more vulnerable than a set of fives, so we need to bet them and deny equity from overcards. 
* (44:30) We mix between betting and checking most hands in our range because we want to be disguised and have board coverage on all runouts. Being disguised with very good frequencies is what makes you an exceptional poker player. 
* (54:30) Some hands like QJs will rely heavily on having a backdoor flush draw in order to bet the flop. Having the potential to backdoor into a value hand that can stack off is crucial to deciding which hands to bluff.
* (56:40) We have to have more value bets than bluffs on the flop because we need to take into account how many bluffs and value bets we’ll have on the river. You can’t have 50% bluffs and 50% value on the flop, otherwise, you’ll show up to the river with way too much garbage.
* (1:00:00) We build out our ranges by starting with our value, in this case, our 4 combos of straights, and then choose 2 combo draws to bluff. 
* (1:01:40) Versus a 1/3 pot bet from SB, BB over-folds massively (40%), calls 47%, and check-raises 12%. The Minimum Defense Frequency (MDF) is 25%, but you have to remember that in multiway pots the MDF is shared between the BB and BTN when the SB bets. 
* (1:06:30) Whether or not you have the nut flush blocker is crucial in determining whether your hand can raise the flop (on 985ss).
* (1:09:00) Monkersolver doesn’t differentiate between 0 EV and -EV folds, so keep that in mind because obviously, not all folds are equal. 
* (1:15:00) Having the ace of spades is such an important blocker because when our opponents have the ace of spades we will face a lot more aggression from them. When we hold it we can tune up the aggression, because our opponents will be less aggressive. 
* (1:17:00) When opponents tend to over-fold, many of our 0 EV bluffs quickly shift to +EV because we are over-realizing equity versus a nitty opponent. 
* (1:22:30) The pairs that we fold facing a SB bet on this board are the bottom pairs that have no real additional equity in the form of backdoor flushes and straights.
* (1:32:00) We can simplify the solver’s frequencies by selecting a few hands and betting them at a 100% frequency, instead of betting a larger amount of holdings at a lower frequency. For example, if we raise a certain frequency of several suited Kx holdings, we can just simplify and raise K7s and K6s, and do away with raises for the rest of them. 
 
(1:35:00) BTN vs SB lead, BB raise on 985ss: 
   * (1:36:00) BTN folds 81%, calls 17%, and only raises 1.4% versus a SB lead and BB raise. Raises include a mix of flush draws, sets, and some hands like middle pair with backdoor and front door draws.  
   * (1:39:00) Solver always pairs it’s aggressive value raises with bluffs that have a decent amount of equity when called. There aren’t any airball raises here. 
   * (1:42:20) Facing a bet and a raise solver is folding most of its overpairs if they do not include a spade. 
   * (1:51:00) We are folding 64 of spades here, which really shows the value of studying solvers since most players would likely continue with the straight and flush draw. We even fold some king-high flush draws when they don’t also have a straight draw, while most players would probably continue.
   * (2:02:15) We can turn a lot of our calling hands into re-raising candidates if we think that our opponents are going to over-fold to a flop 4-bet. This is another way you can exploit players who play passively. If we think that these players are a bit tighter and probably have good hands more often, we can take some of the bluffs out of our 4-betting range and replace them with value hands that were protecting our calling range as an exploit.  
   * (2:10:00) When SB 5-bet shoves, BB calls 24% which includes straights, sets, and some flush draw and straight draw combos. However versus most opponents, when faced with big all-ins we need a set or better to continue.
   * (2:13:30) Versus a SB and BB all-in, BTN folds some 55 but calls 88, 99, and straights. Also called at some frequency are the straight flush draws and ace-high flush draws. Remember that ranges are tighter in real life than solver, so your calling range should probably be a bit stronger than this in most live scenarios.
   * (2:17:30) Versus a BTN 4-bet and a SB all-in, BB folds almost 100% of 55 and basically only continues with 88, 99, and 76.














View Video Notes
* (0:00) SB’s baseline bet frequency on 985ss is just 12% for a 1/3 pot bet, checking almost 88% of the time.
* (1:10) BB opens the pot (after SB check) almost 50% of the time for a 1/3 pot sizing.
* (1:30) BTN c-bets almost 62% after SB and BB check.
* (2:00) When you have a big bet option on a sim the betting frequency will usually decrease. When we bet we want our range to be pretty polarized, meaning that our bets will be less frequent. A smaller bet means that we can bet more linearly, with a wider range of hands.
* (3:20) Versus a BTN c-bet SB check-raises 13.4%, calls 51.9% and folds 34.7%. 
* (4:00) Versus a BTN c-bet BB basically never check-raises (1.3%), calls 63.8%, and folds 35%. This is due to the fact that we already have a complex leading strategy from the BB, if we checked 100% of the time we would definitely have a considerable amount of check-raises. 
* (9:00) Versus a SB 33% lead BB raises 12%, calls 47%, and folds 40%. Versus a SB 33% lead BTN raises 16%, calls 68%, and only folds 15%. 
* (11:20) Versus a BB 33% l;ead BTN raises 15%, calls 55%, folds 29%.

View Video Notes
* (6:40) We typically want to pair our high equity bluffs with the same line we take with our high equity value in multiway pots.
* (10:50) Versus a BTN c-bet, SB is playing the majority of its sets as a check-call as opposed to a check-raise. This is because there are a lot of bad turns and rivers where SB won’t be able to get three streets with its sets, because either the flush or a 4 to a straight card is likely to come. So, the solver protects its check-call range with sets. 
* (13:40) We can check-call an underpair as the SB as a breakeven play. Most Small Blinds will over-fold for sure, not many players will be calling 22-44 on the flop here with BB behind. 
* (16:10) The BB never checks a set or a straight, choosing to lead them at almost a 100% frequency. 
* (18:00) BB is capped when they check, there are a ton of value hands that lead flop at a high frequency and they can have straights, sets, two pairs, etc when they bet. When they check however they are pretty capped, that’s why there is almost no check-raising done by BB (1.3%). 
* (21:40) SB check-raises all of its straights, balancing with some ace-high flush draws and other flush draws. 2nd and 3rd pairs with a gutshot also check-raise, these hands are very playable over future streets.
* (26:30) It’s important to remember that these frequencies will change drastically if you are playing against a looser opponent. Our mediocre holdings go up in value and we can play more aggressively overall. 
* (34:00) Top pair holdings that don’t have many backdoor possibilities like straights or flush draws make for better calls than raises. When raising top pairs make sure you have some backdoor equity to fall back on. This goes for second pair holdings as well, without additional draw equity that are only calling. Strong pair + flush draw or straight draw combos actually play pretty aggressively and raise often.




View Video Notes
* (0:00) We want to look to pair our best value hands with our best bluffs, and pair our worst value hands with our worst bluffs. Our worst bluffs and value may just bet one street, and our best bluffs and value may go for three streets. 
* (3:35) The core bluffs in our betting range are the strong ones, but we still have to find more so we’ll have some secondary bluffs that solver sprinkles in at a low to medium frequency. Without these secondary bluffs, we couldn’t be balanced, because when we hit our high equity bluffs on future streets we’ll need bluffs in our range still. 
* (10:30) Most of our secondary bluffs will be 1 street bluffs unless they hit additional equity on the turn. 
* (13:50) Our worst value bets are the 8x holdings, which will look to bet one street and go into bluff catching mode most often, if unimproved.




View Video Notes
* (3:00) Many of the fringe/borderline folds that we make in the BB facing a SB lead are hands that can also call, especially if you think your opponent is pretty loose. Hands like ace-ten of diamonds are being folded some of the time, it’s up to your in-game reads as to whether or not you want to actually fold this combo. 
* (9:40) The weakest pairs that have good blockers (that have more strategic options across future streets) are the fridge holdings that are borderline indifferent between calling and folding. 
* (10:50) We always continue with gutshots that have good blockers, while folding gutshots that don’t have any blockers. 
* (13:30) When SB bets, BB calls, BTN’s over-calling range is decently wide (47%). However, we almost never call our weak pairs, only continuing with the flush draw + pair holdings (mainly by raising them). 
* (17:10) The majority of the time when you have an overcard with a backdoor straight or flush draw you’ll be continuing in position (after SB bets, BB calls). Without this additional equity, your overcards will mainly be folding.
* (25:40) In multiway pots, when we face a 1/3 c-bet we basically never fold a pair, and the fringe holdings include gutshots and good overcards. The only time we fold our weak pairs is when we face a 1/3 pot bet and a call, and then it’s only the weakest pairs that fold. You’ll notice in-game that people tend to fold a lot wider than this, so you can adjust your strategy accordingly.










  
  

oop srp^ bc in srp oop, there calling range is more dense on stronger hands and we have more air and are forced to check more.






Dowbload to all the boards oop srp utg vs button (has turns as well). GREAT THING!!!!
link to it here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pOc7ZPfkx436H0elLPCz3nh-_b1nI8aG/edit#gid=288438731


**INFO BELOW BASED ON THIS LINK ABOVE. Also info below is OOP.


When hand doesnt need protection and isnt 3 streets value can check decent frequency. Main ex: ace high flops w an ace and mid kicker rainbow board.


Ace high boards: check a little more bc dont need protection rly (unless draw heavy sometimes needs prot). Have more and better aces then the ip, but not as much prot needed


King high: bets more than ace high bc needs more prot. Also we have more kings than ip


Queen high: less than king, slightly less than ace. Reason is bc button / ip has more offsuit queens than kings.


Jack high: kinda similar to queen w slightly more cbetting. 


10 high: rarely ever ever cbet. Its bc we just have so many over cards like kj, aq, and so few tens. We also do not have equity advantage here, so naturally need to check a crap ton.


9 high and below: basically same as 10 high.


10 HIGH AND BELOW OOP SRP AS PFR: can simplify and check whole range

MP flop strategy (oop)
 
 
Low connected flops
 
We play a very high flop x strategy on these flops because of how wide our range is. The OOP player is opening approx 21%, and IP is flatting approx 6%. This means that on low boards the OOP player has so much air he can't justify betting wide. This is proven in the equities on some of these flops.
 
987 we check 100%
653 we check 90%
853fd/732r we check 70%.
 
On any flops that we DO want to cbet on, we want to use a 75% sizing. The reason for this is that we have an equity disadvantage, we are OOP, and as ever when we are playing a very high flop x strategy we simply prefer a larger cbet size.
 
As with any aspect of poker, when we are the preflop aggressor and play a high frequency flop x strategy, we need to have a solid freq x/r strategy.
 
987 we x/r approx 16%
653 we x/r approx 16%
853fd we x/r approx 20%
732r we x/r approx 20%
 
Our x/r's are obvious on the straight draw flops, but on 732r type flops we elect to choose hands like KQs with a BDFD, A4s, overpairs at a much higher frequency etc.
 
 
Middling connected flops
 
As above, we play a very high flop x strategy. Even though our range connects a little better with T high/J high flops, the IP player still has an equity advantage on all of the flops we have run. Again, the more turned straights possible, the more frequently we check.
 
JT9 we x 100%
T86 we x 100%
T54 we x 60%
T52 we x 73%
 
Again, when we are checking so wide, we need to play a solid x/r strategy on these boards, and it is a similar sort of range that wants to x/r.
 
 
A high flops with no additional broadways
 
These are relatively tricky to simplify as the solver is quite erratic. On these textures we are going to play a check frequency of approximately 70%. The best way to simplify is to group all of these flops together and play them as similarly as possible. On the disconnnected flops we use a 33% size, on the wheel flops we use a 75% size.
 
 
When we are playing a strategy that involves so many checks, we bet our strongest top pairs at a high frequency, and we 'ladder down' and bet our weakest top pairs at a much lower frequency.
 
We x/r very rarely on these flops. The reason for this is the IP player will use a larger size a lot and we don't x/r very much at all vs a larger size. We can exploitatively x/r a little wider than the solver suggests with our value because people will stab less with bluffs on this board.
 
 
One broadway flops
 
As we can see from the spreadsheet our equity is pretty neutral in this spot on the Q high and J high boards, but we have a slight equity advantage on the K high flops. We can make a solid simplification of what boards to bet wider on/what boards to check wider on, and it's to do with the remaining two cards. If they are middling/connected we don't cbet as often. If they are lower than a 6 we can bet them a little wider. The preflop charts give us a great indication as to why that is.
 
The preferred size varies quite a lot, but I am going to recommend a 33% flop size in these situations; if we bet 33% on Q75r are our opponents floating T9s, A3s, 22 etc? Probably not, so I would elect to use the smaller size when betting!
 
Boards that are good for the OOP player's range (finally!)
 
The main type of boards that are consistently good for the OOP player are double broadway boards. Despite this we do need to play a very high frequency check strategy on some of these textures. The boards that we can cbet the most are AKx  and KQx type boards with a low third card...
 
Again, when the solver is so erratic we need to devise a simplified strategy that is easy to implement. My advice would be to still check the A high flops and the Q high flops at a decent frequency, and to bet the KQx, KJx etc type flops at a much higher frequency than the rest of the data we have seen so far!
 
 
Monotone flops
 
We continue to play a very high flop x strategy on monotone flops. The trend of what flops we can bet wider than others is consistent (low/connected flops are range checks, higher flops we have some betting frequency)...
 
764sss we x 100%
962sss we x 100%
Q83sss we x 80%
AQ2sss we x 70%
K53sss we x 55%d

We don't x/r very much at all on monotone boards, and we keep it simple and x/r our A2-A5ss that unblock our opponent's flush draws, and mix in some Ax/Kx of spade type hands.

CO flop strategy (OOP)




Low or middling connected flops


The difference between MP and CO's strategy is significant; there are certain flops that MP could bet sometimes in this spot, but that so rarely applies to CO. CO is doing a ton more checking, and has a lot more flops that it wants to check its entire range (or close enough to it that we want to simplify).


987 we check 100% (same as MP)
653 we check 100% (MP was 90%)
853 we check 100%  (MP was 70%)
732 we check 87% (MP was 70%)


Before we look at the x/r range in these spots let's look at some flops that are slightly higher...


T86 we check 98%
T54 we check 98%
T52 we check 99%


If we look at our spreadsheet, it's clear to see that as our range gets wider we are checking so unbelievably often OTF in so many situations. We can essentially simplify and say that any flop that is 10 high and below we check our entire range.


What is the reason for this? Our range has gone from 21% to 29%, but the BTN's range is still around 5.5%. This means that our range gets wider, our equity goes down and therefore we have to do a ton of checking CO vs BTN.


How does this affect our x/r strategy? Let's take a look.


As we will see, we will x/r more combos CO vs BTN than we will do MP vs BTN, but the frequency will only go up slightly because the range is wider. So a perfect example is on 732r our x/r frequency will go up slightly, but the physical number of combos will increase drastically. The reason for that is in MP we have no T7s, 97s, J7s etc, but we do have these hands in CO, and they want to x/r sometimes. We also have more 'two-over-BDFD-BDSD' type hands. The summary for this is our x/r range is roughly the same, but on disconnected flops we want to x/r more with our TP hands/backdoor draw hands/overpairs, because we have more of them!




A high flops with no additional broadways


CO does a ton more checking on these flops as you'd expect. The MP player likes to bet A43, A52 type boards and check on A83 type disconnected boards, whereas the CO does the opposite. I think it's a far superior strategy to play in MP the same as CO does (i.e. we check wide on the wheel A high flops, but bet the disconnected flops at a slightly higher frequency).


Our x/r range is very similar to MP vs BTN, we want to x/r our strongest top pairs, and any hands that have equity (e.g. K6ss on As6s2x). On the more disconnected A high boards, we x/r at a higher frequency, and when we have no 'natural bluffs', we want to x/r hands like J8dd on A94dsc etc (bdsd/bdfd type hands).


Double broadway boards


There are two different categories here; boards that we check really wide on, and boards that we bet really wide on. The strategy for boards that we check really wide on is very similar to MP vs BTN, however on the boards that we want to bet really wide on (AKx, KQx etc) we can actually bet these at a WIDER frequency than MP vs BTN. The reason for this is again down to preflop. We're opening a wider range, and therefore we have significantly more Kx and Qx hands that connect with these flops, and therefore our range is doing very well on them.


Again, the Q high and J high flops are not as good as the K high flops, so we do play a relatively higher checking frequency on these.


The preferred size that we want to cbet varies from board to board. I strongly recommend a 33% cbet size for simplification purposes, as people will not float as wide as they should in theory, and thus our bluffs are cheaper.


Given IP prefers a larger stab size on these flops, our x/r frequency is relatively low, and as ever when it is relatively low it's easy to work out what hands we want to x/r.




Monotoned flops


Our strategy is slightly different CO vs BTN on these boards. Again, on the low boards like 962sss, 764sss etc we want to play a pure flop check, but on the double broadway boards we want to bet slightly more frequently. Much like MP vs BTN, our x/r strategy is going to revolve around hands like A2-A5ss, and a mixed frequency with NFDs/2nd NFDs.


 
BTN vs MP flop strategy (IP)
 
Low/middling connected flops
 
The MP player plays a high check strategy on these flops with a big sized cbet. This is because their range has less equity and therefore they must check a lot. On the flip side to that our range has a lot of equity, and therefore we can stab relatively wide for a 33% size. The range that wants to bet is really even amongst all the hands that we have. We check a little more with our AT/AJ/AQ showdown type hands, and we bet wide with our KT/QJ/K9 etc type hands, regardless of whether or not we have a FD or BDFD.
 
The solver is very consistent with regards to stabbing frequencies...
 
963r we stab 61%
842fd we stab 56%
987fd we stab 75%
765fd we stab 65%
T54r we stab 60%
 
There doesn't appear to be any simplification that we can make on these boards. It appears that we simply stab a variety of different hands at a decent frequency.
 
When we do bet and we get x/r'd, we continue with a very standard range of pairs/draws. We have some very marginal floats that we can simply just fold. People won't x/r flops anywhere near as much as they should, so when they do we can fold hands like KJs on 732r. We simply continue with equity.
 
Our 3bet frequency is so low on all of these boards, approx 5% total. We can essentially 3b the top of our range and a couple of strong draws. 987ssd and 842dss are perfect examples.
 
When our opponent does cbet on these types of boards our raising frequency is extremely low, capped at approx 5% (and sometimes not raising at all). 532fd, 732r are perfect examples of how our strategy changes depending on the size that OOP uses.
 
A high flops with no additional broadways
 
The solver is mixing sizings here. It is betting 75% on connected boards like A54fd, A74fd, and it chooses 33% on less connected flops like A83r, A72r etc. My advice would be to choose one size across all low A high boards and use 75%. We stab a mixture of everything, but we check back hands like KQ and KJ and our lowest TPs  at a very high frequency. Note that we use 22-55 as a high frequency stab, they unblock a lot of villain's folding range!
 
Note that we do a lot of checking back on these textures. When you combine our low stab frequency and our 75% sizing, MP should not be raising us very much at all (3 or 4% frequency on average). On the rare occasion we do get raised we proceed VERY cautiously (as shown by unticking 'square size to proportional weight' in PIO.
 
 
One broadway flops
 
Similarly to the above flops, the solver is stabbing at quite a high frequency for the 33% sizing. The range also looks quite similar; a mixture of everything with some SDV hands checked back at a higher frequency. The general trend is that when we have more equity, we stab a balanced range of hands around 60% of the time. When we get x/r'd we do a fair amount of folding (given how wide we're stabbing) and continue with stronger parts of our range only. Our preferred sizing is still 33%.
 
General trend appears to be on the lower boards that are better for our range we stab around 60-65% of the time. On the boards that get better for OOP we stab less, around 50%.
 
On boards like Q75r and J63r when x/r'd the solver likes to float hands like KTbdfd, A4bdfd etc. Let's never do this for very obvious reasons!
 
Summary – respect aggression from our opponents and don't float too much K high type hands
 
 
Double broadway flops
 
When checked to on low connected flops we can bet really wide for a small size because we have an equity advantage and connect well with these boards. The opposite applies on boards like KQ2, QT5 etc. We now become more polarised with our betting range, we check back around 66% of the time, and we stab for a 75% size when we do bet.
 
Our range that wants to stab on these textures are obvious. Gutshots, straight draws, flush draws, stronger TPs and 2p+.
 
In terms of our bluffs we have the obvious 'natural bluffs', we also use our low PPs that unblock our opponent's folding range, and also hands like A3s-A5s that have a BDFD/BDSD
 
Again, given how rarely we get x/r'd here, we only continue with good equity hands; perfect example is on KT3ssd, we bet/fold AQo with no spade.
 
 
Monotone flops
 
Monotone flops continue with the trend of everything we have just learned in terms of stabbing frequency, the only difference is we always prefer a 33% size when stabbing. Broadway boards we are stabbing around 25% of the time, lower more connected boards we want to stab around half the time. It's interesting to note we still stab hands like JThh at a relatively high frequency on 962sss. Note that we bet less frequently on a board like J85sss (and even less on K53sss). Essentially the lower the board the more frequently we stab
 
Please note that on a board like 963sss we can stab really wide with our airballs, but on these K hi, A hi etc monotone boards these overcard type hands are non existant, and that drives down our betting frequency




BTN vs CO flop strategy (IP)




Low or middling connected flops


As you'll remember we chose to simplify our strategy as the OOP player and check everything that is T high and below. The reason for this is important; the equity that OOP has on a lot of these boards is very low. This also means that the IP player can stab extremely wide. The trend appears to be that the lower/more connected the flop, the more frequently IP can stab.


532s – 80%
765s – 90%
853s – 82%
743r – 62%


There are a few flops that prefer to use a more polarised strat of stabbing less/using a larger size. I've created a quick aggregate report to show that it's pretty obvious what these are, T92, T87, T86 etc.


As we can see from the doc, these are so few and far between that we want to just simplify and use the 33% size on all T high flops and below.




A high flops with no additional broadways


I've put a little table below to show the difference in the BTN's strategy vs MP and CO. This helps us to see more clearly the general trend...


Flop        BTN stab freq vs MP        BTN stab freq vs CO
A83r        36.00%        51.00%
A94r        35.00%        52.00%
A53fd        29.00%        36.00%
A62fd        35.00%        35.00%
A63r        35.00%        50.00%




The general trend is obvious; the more disconnected the flop, the more we stab. The more connected the flop, the more identical our strategy is vs MP. The reason for this is the BTN has slightly more equity vs CO on these boards (        , and therefore BTN can stab wider vs CO than it can vs MP – the wider the OOP range, the better the IP player does on a lot of textures).


It's interesting to note that vs MP (and UTG although we don't have the data to back that up) we are more polarised when we bet here and use the 75% size. The solver is actually very consistent and likes to use a 33% size when stabbing a bunch of these disconnected A high flops, and uses a 75% size on the low/connected/wheel flops.


I will leave it up to you to build your own strategy in this exact spot – if you want to use one size on all A high flops then choose 75%. If you feel confident to use 33% on A high disconnected flops and 75% on low/wet flops, that's completely fine. We can choose one of these two options and apply it to BTN vs MP and BTN vs CO. Just be consistent!


Our opponent's x/r strat will be dependent on our stab size. Note how tight the solver x'rs vs the big size compared to the small size.




One broadway flops


As expected, the trend continues and our strategy is very similar vs CO as it is vs MP, the difference is we stab a bit wider. I've chosen a few flops and insterted a table again to re-iterate this point...




Flop        BTN stab freq vs MP        BTN stab freq vs CO
Q76r        51.00%        60.00%
K73r        54.00%        56.00%
J54r        56.00%        63.00%
K87fd        49.00%        44.00%
Q74fd        50.00%        56.00%


As we can see from the table, we stab at a slightly higher frequency on the Q high and J high boards, but our strategy is consistent on the K high boards (again we don't replicate the solver identically, we just know that we can comfortably stab a little more vs CO than we can vs MP).


Our range that continues vs a x/r is virtually identical. We continue with hands that have equity, we fold our low PPs and we continue with any flopped pairs.


Summary – on these flops our strategy is extremely similar vs CO as it is vs MP, we just stab a little more!




Double broadway flops


On these boards our opponent is going to cbet more than any other type of board we've seen so far. We actually play a decent frequency raising range when we face a cbet. We tend to raise our bottom set always, our top two pair a decent amount, and we scatter in some high equity bluffs (note that we have a lot of natural bluffs here so we don't really need to find any unnatural bluffs).


The difference in raising ranges on QJ2fd and KJ3r is quite interesting.


Similarly to the single broadway section, our strategy is actually virtually identical, we just stab at a slightly higher frequency. Whilst the solver does appear to prefer a 33% size more often, it's not significant enough for us to want to change our sizing scheme (in other words we still use 75% when checked to as we are betting polarised).








Monotone flops


The solver appears to be really consistent here with regards to strategy/stabbing frequency (which is great!). The strategy is therefore really similar vs CO as it is vs MP; on boards that have high cards/are better for OOP's range we don't stab anywhere near as much as we do on low/connected boards. Again the reason for this is on something like 963sss we can stab JThh/QTdd etc but on K53/KJ9sss we don't want to stab these hands.






MP turn strategy (OOP)


There are a bunch of different ways that we can get to the turn, flop can go x/x, we can x/c, we can x/r, we can cbet and villain calls, we can cbet and call a raise etc etc. This makes for a very broad topic within the module. To make the best use of our time we are going to pick several different flops on a range of different boards and look at each of these scenarios within that flop. Instead of looking at one flop from start to finish, we are going to look at the actions on each flop.


Please note that on flops that we check really wide on, we still check a ton on the turn, at most we're betting at around a 50% frequency. The reason for this is that we still have an equity disadvantage in theory even after flop goes x/x.


After flop goes x/x


653fd/986fd - we are uncapped because we x our entire range, but our opponent has weakened his range, because he doesn't x back strong hands all that often. We tend to bet 33% on straight and flush completing turns. The solver plays differently on these two textures but I think favouring a 33%/75% sizing scheme is going to be higher EV than using overbets in general.


Summary – on any flop that we x our entire range on, we are going to use a 33% size on any straight/flush completing card or any Q/K/A, and we're going to bet 75% on any bricks.


732r - as above, our opponent's range gets weaker after flop goes x/x, but ours still stays the same given we have a high x freq (whilst not quite checking our entire range).


T54r – again, in theory we do a ton of overbetting here on the low cards, the board pairing cards and the high cards, and we elect to use a smaller size for everything in between. This appears to be a significant trend on these low/middling flops.


Simplifcation – we have decided that we want to use the overbet size on board pairing cards when the card that pairs is lower than a 7. E.g. on 732 we are going to overbet a 7, 3 or 2, but on T54 we are going overbet a 5 or a 4. As ever, we are going to use a 33% size on Q, K, A turns because our opponents won't stab flop as much as they should with their broadway airballs and therefore they will have more turned TPs in their range than they should.


Q42r – similar to the above board, we do a lot of overbetting in theory on the high cards, and anything in between chooses a more merged 75% sizing. When we compare this to something like J63r the strategy is quite different, and I think a 33% size is going to work really well again here on the overcards. We're going to use 75% on all bricks essentially.


JT9fd - on these high connected flops we can use a small turn stab after flop x/x on every turn. This is consistent with all flops of this kind (e.g. KQ9fd was the exact same).


KJ3r - it's interesting to note that the solver rarely uses a 75% sizing. The trend we've seen so far is an overbet on small cards and big cards, and a 33% size on straight completing cards. The big cards in this instance are straight completing cards, and the solver still appears to prefer a 33% size. This means that 33% clearly takes priority.


Summary – any flops that are 2 broadways or more, we can bet really wide OTT after x/x for 33% size. This is relatively consistent within the solver when we DON'T bet too wide OTF, but we can even use this strat on flops that we do bet relatively wide on (e.g. on KQ9fd we're not supposed to bet too wide OTF, but on KJ3r we are – the turn strat of 33% stab is going to be consistent on both these textures).


A83r – the solver loves a 33% turn probe on so many different turns here. We can check this with A43fd and AJ9r to confirm that the solver is consistent with this strategy. The exception to this rule appears to be on a king turn across all the different boards, where it prefers an overbet.


Simplifcation – overbet on low board pairing cards, low cards in general and broadway cards. Bet 33% on straight/flush completing cards. Bet 75% on middling cards. 33% takes priority. On A high flops our turn probe size is just 33% always (but we can overbet a king if we want to remember that).




When we x/r flop


653fd – the solver is mixing between 33, 75 and 125. I really like the idea of using 33% and 100% as a simplifcation/compromise. We check more on connected turns that complete straights and/or flushes, and when we do bet we bet 33%. We bet broadway cards at a higher frequency, and we use a larger size when we bet these. We also use the pot size on board pairing cards. Really important – we continue on the turn with equity, we give up our airballs!


732r – the solver is reluctant to use the smaller size on this texture, generally favouring 75% and 125% (we're obviously going to use 100% instead). Interesting to note the difference in strategy on straight completing cards on this texture. We should use 33% on the lower cards and then pot on the larger cards. This is a simplifcation which gives us a solid, consistent strategy.


T54r – the solver is proving consistent with big sizing on low pairing cards. Interestingly it likes to use a smaller size on bigger cards on this texture. I am going to combine T54r and Q42r here. As we can see Q42 doesn't apply this small sizing throughout. I think we can simplify and say that we want to use 33% on straight completing cards and overcards, but a pot size on anything else. I think this strategy is going to be far easier to implement.


Summary – on a board like 653fd we don't xr too much KQs, AJs etc so when the broadway cards come OTT we can still use pot, but on a board like 732, T54 etc where we do xr a ton of BD broadways OTF, we can elect to use a 33% size OTT when these hit. Also on T54 there are so few bricks that don't complete a straight that we rarely use a PSB, but on Q42 there are a lot more and therefore we have more PSBs in our range.


JT9fd - given how narrow our flop x/r range is, we essentially always have some equity OTT. We elect to continue to bet with the higher equity hands (e.g. we give up with bdfd K8s but keep betting the K8s with a flushdraw). Our size is always pot because of how narrow a range we are betting.


Summary – any flop that is high broadway and really connected, we elect to continue OTT with a PSB because both ranges have become drastically narrower. We only continue with our strong draws.


KJ3r – again we don't x/r this flop too often, which means our turn barreling range is easy to work out. Similar to above, in any spot we don't x/r wide OTF we prefer to use a large turn size throughout.


A83r – again, not x/r'ing too often here. We are going to use the bigger size when we do bet the turn. We can compare this flop to A43fd and see that the solver prefers the larger size even on a wetter board.


Simplification – in general when we don't xr too wide OTF we are more polarised OTT and prefer to use the pot size. On the flipside when we do x/r really wide OTF we elect to use a 33% size on a bunch of different turn cards (mainly overcards/straight completing cards).




When we x/c flop


General notes


We don't do very much check raising OTT after we x/c flop. We can x/r hands like turned 2p, any sets that elected to xc the fop, and also any turned combo draws we may have.


We start to x/f our underpairs/weaker holdings, even more than the solver suggests. Our opponents don't stab turn enough, and therefore these more marginal hands become easy folds.


We can look at a few different textures to get a feel for what hands we want to continue with OTT, but the general strategy is the same. Continue with equity, x/r strong hands and strong draws, and start to fold our weaker pairs etc




When we bet the flop and BTN calls


653fd/JT9fd – we x our entire range OTF so this is n/a.


732r – the solver recommends using a 33% size on a range of turn cards. Given we bet 75% OTF I am not a fan of 'big flop small turn' strategies, so any flop we bet 75% on, we should use 75% and 125% OTT. We are overbetting board pairing cards and using 75% on anything else. Note how infrequently we bet smaller cards here, and how much more often we continue on broadway cards


T54r – very similar to above strat in terms of overbetting low paired cards, and using 75% on anything else. Again we are betting broadways at a much higher frequency than low bricks.


Q42r – this is the first time we've seen the solver overbet OOP on the turn. It's not often we see an OOP overbet on a majority of turns. If we look at T62 and J63 it would appear that there isn't much overbetting going on, and Q42 appears to be the exception rather than the rule. If we look at K32 it appears to want to overbet too.


Simplifcation – our general sizing scheme is that we want to use an overbet on all bricks and all low board pairing cards, and a 75% size on overcards/straight completing cards.


Simplification - If we use a big size OTF, we can use a big size again OTT. If we use 33% OTF, the solver actually likes using 33% again OTT.


KJ3r – the solver much prefers 33% OTF here, which means that we follow the rule and bet 33% OTT when we do want to bet.


A83r – again, we want to bet small OTF here, which means we bet small OTT according to the solver. We can check this against A43fd, which does prefer a bigger sized cbet, and sticks to the rule of big/big.




Simplifcation – when it comes to flop/turn sizes we can have small/small, small/big and big/big, but never big/small.


Simplification – the more frequently we bet on the flop (i.e. with a 33% size), the more likely we are to use a 33% size OTT. On the flipside the less frequently we bet on the flop (i.e. with a 75% size) the bigger our turn size.


 
CO turn strategy (OOP)
 
This section of the module will not be as thick as the previous section (MP turn strategy) as it is a comparison of how CO plays compared to how MP plays. We're looking for similarities/trends that we can use as best as possible, and the strategies are very similar.
 
After flop goes x/x
 
We know that we have simplified and checked our entire range on these T high and below textures.
 
653/986fd – as mentioned in the previous part of the module, the solver actually quite likes using either 33% or 125%, with the larger size being favoured slightly more. Again, I don't think our opponents stab hands like KTs, KJo etc as much as the solver suggests, so for exploitative reasons I think we should favour the 33% size much more heavily on these broadway cards. Note that we are choosing between these two options because the solver just never uses 75%.
 
The lower the board, the more we overbet a board pairing card (i.e. on 653ssd3h we overbet the turn, but on 986fd8x we use 75%).
 
I will let you define your own strategy here. If you think your opponents stab sufficiently when checked to OTF, we should use the overbet when they x/b. If you think they don't do this, then a 33% size is going to be preferred!
 
Please also note that when the flop goes x/x we still don't do too much delay cbetting in this spot.
 
732r – it's tough to come up with a solid strategy because the solver loves to overbet here after flop goes x/x. I think we should stick with the above sizing scheme and use 125% on all low board pairing cards and 33% on middling cards/J+. If we want we can use a 75% size on the middling cards, but that's quite tough to remember because it involves using 3 sizes. Again, the solver is mixing between small and big (whilst marginally favouring big) so both options are fine, we just run into TP more often in reality than the solver does, and therefore we prefer to use a smaller size here. Note the solver folds 20% of the time on 732rQx but in reality people's folding ranges will be far greater.
 
T54r – It's interesting that the solver likes to overbet the 2x/3x here but it doesn't on 986fd. I think we should stick with our 75% sizing scheme on undercards. We overbet the low board pairing cards, and we use 33% on essentially everything else. Again, the solver mixes between 33% and 125% on broadways, but as stated already a few times, 33% will work well here.
 
The strategy so far – overbet low board pairing cards, bet 33% on any flush completing cards/significant straight completing cards, bet 75% on bricky undercards and choose between 33% or 125% on broadways depending on what you want your own strategy to be.
 
Q42r – If we follow the above paragraph and continue to implement this strategy, we overbet 2x/4x, we bet small on Kx/Ax, and we bet 75% on 6x-Qx. Really easy to follow/understand. Please also note that if we take J63r and 986fd and look at the betting frequencies, we'll note that despite being very different textures the trend is the same – the higher the card, the more frequently we bet. This is very consistent throughout the entire solver.
 
JT9fd – this is identical to the MP strategy. When the flop is higher/super connected we always use 33% on the turn when we want to bet. QJ8fd is the same if we want a comparison (whilst it does prefer a bigger size on bricks for simplifcation we can just bet 33%).
 
KJ3r – an identical strategy to MP on these types of boards. Given how wide we're supposed to bet the flop our range is weakend when we do x/b (note the difference in equity OTF compared to OTT). As ever we prefer to use the smaller size here. QT6fd plays slightly differently on the lower cards, but again we will still use 33% on these low cards.
 
A83r – a really similar strategy to MP. We don't do too much stabbing at all, but when we do, we use the 33% size. Again, the higher the turn, the more frequently we stab.
 
General trends from x/x flop – bet small on straight/flush completing turns, and Q/K/A turns. Bet 75% on any brick turns, any middling/high board pairing cards. Bet 125% on low board pairing cards.
 
General trends – when the flop is broadway heavy OR A high we want to use a 33% turn probe on all the turns. Note that the higher the turn the more frequently we stab.
 
 
When we x/r the flop
 
The solver is extremely consistent with MP's strategy. A quick summary of what that is...
 
We have two sizes, 33% and 100%. The 100% size is a compromise between 75% and 125%, and essentially allows us to play for stacks. We use 33% on any straight/flush completing cards.
 
On 732r we x/r a ton of broadway cards, so we want to use a 33% size on these broadway cards, but on 653fd type boards we don't xr KQhh anywhere near as much, so we prefer the pot sized bet.
 
In game, ask yourself “do I x/r this flop quite wide with my broadways?” If the answer is yes, we can use a 33% size on the broadway turns. If the answer is no, we prefer to use a pot sized bet.
 
If the board is high/connected like JT9fd, KQ9fd etc, our x/r range is quite narrow, so our betting range OTT after x/r is small and therefore one size of pot is preferred.
 
On A high boards and single broadway boards, when we do x/r our opponent continues with quite a strong range. We start to check quite wide OTT so when we do bet we use the PSB.
 
 
When we x/c the flop
 
Our strategy is extremely similar to MP; we don't do very much check raising at all. We have some very infrequent sets that didn't x/r the flop, turned 2pairs and our strong draws/combo draws that we have turned. Again, we fold our underpairs/marginal holdings here.
 
T62r is a perfect example of what our turn x/r range looks like. Also see 732r9c as well.
 
 
When we bet flop and BTN calls
 
A lot of the preset examples fall under the rule of “check our entire range” because they are T high and below. As mentioned in the 'CO vs BTN flop strategy' part of the module we do a lot more checking on A high flops, single broadway flops etc. This means that our range is narrower when we do bet the flop on these types of textures.
 
 
General A high strategy
 
As we can see when we look at A83r the solver consistently prefers the 33% size OTT after betting 33% OTF. Compare that to A43fd and we can see we clearly prefer a big bet OTT after a big bet OTF.
 
Single broadway flops.
 
Our turn size is dependent on our flop strategy (similarly to MP strat). If we look at Q42r we can see that the solver does prefer a 75% flop size.
 
If we choose a 33% flop strategy, we only use 33% OTT.
 
If we choose a 75% flop strategy, we overbet brick turns and bet 75% on overcards.
 
We have to choose a strategy that suits us. If we think our opponents call correctly vs a 33% size, we should use 75%. If we think our opponents are folding more than the solver, we should use 75%. It's important to nail down that flop strategy because it significantly affects our turn strategy.
 
KJ3r – similarly to MP vs BTN (and everything above), the trend still applies. We bet 33% OTF and we continue that with 33% OTT. Interestingly the solver bets quite wide here. We can also compare this to KJ4fd and QJ2fd and see that the solver is consistent, and on QJ2fd when we bet less frequently OTF (but still for the 33% sizing) we bet less frequently OTT (again still for that 33% sizing)
 
When we bet a wide range OTF, we bet a wide range OTT. When we bet a narrow range OTF, we bet a narrow range OTT.
 
General monotone flop discussion
 
The solver does a little bit of cbetting flop on certain monotone boards MP vs BTN but the trend is that we never cbet monotone flops CO vs BTN, unless the board is two broadway disconnected. We'll see that AJ3sss and AQ2sss we want to bet sometimes, but KJ9sss, 962sss, J85sss etc we want to pure check. Please note that even on the flops we have a betting range on we're still not betting very wide at all!
 
When the flop goes x/x we want to do a lot of checking again, but we actually stab the spade turns really wide. So 962sss when flop goes x/x we x a bunch on brick turns, but spade turns we want to stab with some of our airballs.
 
Summary – bluff 4 card flush turns really wide!


BTN vs MP turn strategy (IP)


I'm going to construct this part of the module similarly to MP vs BTN. We're going to pick 8 flops and note the strategy on each way we get to the turn, and we'll use a couple of random flops here and there to prove the solver's consistency.


After flop goes x/x and OOP x's again


653fd/986fd – 33% on straight and flush completing turns/broadways, 75% on anything else. We
can use 743r to see that already the solver is very consistent. Again note that we are supposed to stab flop relatively wide, and if we don't OOP is supposed to stab turn around 40ish%, so when it does go x/x x, we're not betting all that much, around 50% on the most frequently bet turn card.


The reason we want to stab broadways so wide for 33% is because OOP massively caps themselves when they x flop and x turn.


732r – identical to above. Low cards, straight completing cards, board pairing cards it uses 33%. On middling 8/9/T cards it uses 75%, and on any J/Q/K it uses 33%.


On all the above 3 boards the solver uses small on J/Q/K but overbets the ace. This is because of just how infrequently we bet the ace, we're very polarised. Try and include it in your strategy if you can but if you want to simplify and bet 33% on all broadways that's fine too.


T54r – this appears to be when the solver starts to play a little differently OTT. Again it's using 75% on bricks and 33% on board pairing/straight completing cards, but it likes to start to overbet the overcards. When we compare this to J83r and Q75r we can see that the solver is quite consistent.


Summary – on low disconnected boards we do a lot of small betting, but when the highest card becomes a ten we start to overbet the overcards. We can define our own strategy here. T54r is a perfect example – on a 3 turn we are betting 33%, on a 9 turn we are betting 75%, on a K turn we are betting 133%. Do we want to ditch the 133% size and just use 75% on these overcard turns? I think that's the best idea, but if you feel confident having 3 sizes that's completely fine too.


Q42 is identical to the above strategy. It does prefer a 33% size on some brick turns but we're going to simplify and use 75%.


JT9fd – we're rarely betting the flop here, so when we do bet the turn, we use the 75% size (apart from straight completing cards where we use 33%). We can compare this strategy to QJ8fd to confirm the strategy is consistent.


Quickly sidetracking and looking at double broadway flops in general, when we get to this part of the tree we see that we do a TON of checking back, and we can simplify our strategy to only use 75% when we bet. If we look at QJ2fd and KJ3r we can see that the solver is consistent.


Summary – we do a ton of checking back OTT on the boards where the flop wasn't good for us OR when the turn brings double broadway, but when we do bet we can use one simple 75% sizing.


A high boards – the solver is a bit all over the place here. We can determine that both 'double broadway boards' and 'ace high boards' are boards that we don't stab very often OTF/OTT so when we do want to stab OTT we can just use a 75% size. The solver agrees with that on double broadway boards but not necessarily ace high boards, but for simplification purposes we can class them as “boards we aren't betting very often” and use 75% when we do want to stab. This ties in nicely with the bolded section above in terms of simplifying our strategy to make it easier to follow!




After flop goes x/x and OOP stabs


653fd – our strategy is dependent on what size our opponent uses. As ever within the solver vs small bets we raise more frequently than we do vs big bets. Given we have a balanced x/b range that contains overpairs/NFDs our raising range is going to be really easy to work out. We don't raise too often but we raise overpairs sometimes, turned combo draws, turned 2p, turned sets etc. That's going to be a really consistent theme throughout.


986fd – plays exactly as above.


732r – plays as above. Note on the Th turn that we are raising 18.32% of the time but that is only 5 combos. This really drives home the fact that we are not raising very much at all overall here. Given how wide we should be stabbing OTF our range is quite narrow. Factor in a preferred larger size for OOP = an extremely tight raising range for IP.


Simplification - having looked through the remainder of these textures (and similar ones for comparison) I can confidently state that our strategy is the same on all the different types of boards. When the flop goes x/x and villain stabs turn we raise our turned strong hands, some combo draws at some frequency, and any slowplayed sets OTF. The wetter the texture, the less frequently we raise. When our opponent chooses 75% or 133% OTT we are raising so infrequently compared to a 33% or 50% size.




After villain x/c's flop


653fd – When we get to the turn the bigger the card the more we overbet. We now use 75% on straight/flush completing cards/middling cards. The trend within the solver will be that on these really low boards we shouldn't overbet 8/9/T type turns, and it's not too difficult to remember that, so we should keep it in our strategy.


986fd – it would appear that the solver is going to prove consistent with a strategy of using 75% on straight/flush completing cards and overbetting the low bricks/high cards. If we look at T92r we can see that the solver is really consistent here with it's overbetting, but prefers the 75% on the straight flush completing cards.


Please note that it appears we're still only betting around 50% of the time. The bigger we bet, the less frequently we bet.


General strategy so far – we are going to bet 125% on broadway overcards/bricks, and use 75% on straight/flush completing cards (apart from 4 card straight cards where we will use 33%). We can back this up by looking at 963r. On very low flops we want to bet 75% on middling turns instead of overbetting.


T54r – T54 prefers a 75% size on undercards to the T and overbets on the overcards. J63r prefers an overbet on basically every turn. It's tough to define a strategy when the solver is preferring vastly different strategies on similar board textures. This is why we look for simplifcations.


General strategy – we want to bet 75% on straight/flush completing cards/board pairing cards/middling cards, and bet 125% on overcards (as mentioned we now have more overcards in our range than our opponent on a lot of textures (e.g. on 653dds our opponent folds KQhh but we have that in our stabbing range so on a Q turn we are doing better than you'd think)).


If we look at some double broadway boards/boards we are supposed to stab big on OTF/A high boards, we'll see that the strategy is different. On KQ2r we bet 125% on the bricks, and 75% on the straight completing cards. Even on A high boards like A83r we still prefer the overbet size. We should use the 125% on these double broadway flops/A high flops (even the A high flops where we bet 33%).


What have we learned/why is the solver doing this? OTT we rarely play a small bet size IP (even when we're not the preflop aggressor). When our opponent x/c's he has very few airballs in his range and therefore we prefer the overbet size (and betting at a lower frequency).


Overall summary of general strat – 75% on straight/flush completing cards, overbet bricks and broadways (unless straight completing), and don't bet too much.


As ever, our turn betting range contains hands with equity and very very few airballs. OOP folds out all their trash and we can't just bet willy nilly.




When villain cbets flop and cbets turn or checks turn


Our strategy will be dependent on our opponent's sizing scheme. If OOP bets small OTF they should bet small OTT and we will have more raises. If OOP bets big OTF they should bet big OTT and we'll have less raises.


653fd/986fd/JT9fd – villain in theory checks range OTF so n/a.


732r – villain should do a lot of 75 OTF/75 OTT here so we'll play very few raises on these low textures. We raise any slowplays OTF/turned strong hands, and mix in some gutshots/turned FDs if we have them. When villain checks turn to us we probe a ton of our no equity airballs and we check back our marginal hands like A high and low PPs. If we look at how his equity changes when he checks the turn, this is the reason we can stab so wide.


T54r – this is a perfect example of how much we should raise vs a small size. We have zero slowplays vs small/small so we raise any sets/2p/turned straights etc. As above if villain chooses a larger sizing scheme we don't raise as much with our more marginal holdings, but our sets become fastplays. A great example is on T43ssd8d we don't raise JJ vs a big turn bet, but vs a small turn bet we raise it much more frequently. Again when villain gives up OTT we start to stab quite wide.


General strategy – we have flop slowplays in our range because we are IP so our range can support raising turns (if we were OOP like BB vs BTN we have so few slowplays so it wouldn't make much sense to do so). Raise really wide vs small turn bets, not as wide vs the 75% and never vs the overbet. We are IP so the bigger the bet the less we raise because we can still make the pot bigger ourselves OTR when checked to.


General strategy – stab wide vs turn giveups! This can be proven in the drastic equity change in OOP's range when he checks turn.


Q42r – this is the first spot where we do see overbets from OOP. As you can imagine, we just have zero raises vs overbet size. When checked to we can decide our own strategy here and we can use either 33% or 125% (the solver just never uses 75%). Alternatively a solid strategy is to bet small on lower turns and to overbet the bigger turns (note the difference between 8x and Kx. We bet these bigger turns less frequently. It makes sense for us to play like this because on Q425 we want to bet 88 etc at a decent frequency, but on Q42J we don't want to bet these middling PPs and therefore our range is more polarised.


KJ3r – this is a spot where in theory OOP should go small/small. As above, we are doing more raising than you'd think, and that's because we have slowplays in our range. We want to start raising those flopped slowplays and our stronger TPs. When checked to it's interesting to see that the strategy changes and we only play big bets here. This is again because of how infrequently our middling PPs want to bet (thus making us polarised).


General strategy (and this is a great one) – when checked to OTT ask yourself “do my pocket 8s want to bet here?” if the answer is “yes/sometimes” we choose 33%. If the answer is “not really/never” we choose 125%.


On Q325 our 88 does want to bet. On Q32J it doesn't.
On KJ32 our 88 doesn't want to bet. On KJ3Q it doesn't want to bet.


If we force OOP to bet a board like 732r, even on big turns our 88 still wants to bet (because only one overcard) so we would still choose a 33% size.


Please note that on a board like QJ2fd the pocket 8s rule doesn't apply because we fold our 88 OTF. Given our range narrows significantly to stronger hands, we still want to bet the turn wide when checked to with these hands (perfect example of this is the difference between when OOP bets 33% and when he bets 75%).


A83r – again the solver is really consistent with it's raising strategy/frequencies vs a small/small sizing scheme. We now start to bloat the pot with our slowplayed sets/turned straight draws etc. If our opponents bet 75% or overbet the turn (which they will make the mistake of doing) we continue with strong hands only and play no raises. Note that the solver only uses big bets when probing turn here. This makes sense on an A high board and ties in nicely with the above few examples (A83r and KJ2fd play the same turn probe size strategy). We aren't betting that often when checked to, so when we do, we use the overbet size. We can note the difference between A83r and AQ7fd and decide that we want to keep it simple and only overbet when checked to on A high boards.


 
BTN vs CO turn strategy (IP)
 
Again, this section of the module won't be as long as the BTN vs MP section. We're looking to see if the strategy is the same/similar.
 
After flop goes x/x and OOP x's again
 
653fd – this is moot because we're supposed to stab SO wide OTF vs CO.
 
986fd – 75% on bricks, 33% on straight/flush completing cards (as before). The difference here is that BTN vs CO we want to use a larger size on the broadway cards (we were going 33% on broadways vs MP). We can use 33% on broadway cards and keep our strategy consistent with vs MP. It's tough to have different sizing schemes vs different positions. The difference will be that we want to stab less frequently on these turns because of how much more broadways our opponents open preflop.
 
Our opponents won't check to us as much as they should with turned TPs so when they do they are relatively capped and using a small size on broadway turns makes our bluffs cheaper (whilst still being in line with the solver's strategy on many flops).
 
General notes – 33% on straight/flush completing cards, 75% on low bricks and 33% on broadway cards.
 
T54r/Q42r – identical to above. Again favouring the larger size on broadway turns, and this time we're going to stick with that; as mentioned because of the “pocket 8s rule” we want to use a larger size on the broadway cards because our middling hands don't want to bet as much. The difference here is that on both these boards there are 2 broadway cards on a big turn hence the bigger size preferred. Let's use 33% on the brick turns as the solver is really consistent with that.
 
JT9fd – identical to MP (bet rarely and bet 75% apart from straight completing turns). QJ8fd is a relatively similar board and we can see the solver is checking back a ton but favours a bigger size when betting.
 
KJ3r – annoyingly the solver favours an overbet here instead of the 75% size we saw vs MP. Let's keep to that strategy and bet infrequently. When we do bet we bet 75% (apart from Qx/Tx turns where we bet 33%). Note that we are stabbing more vs CO than we are vs MP; when they check twice they're just going to really struggle to continue. Equity OOP nosedives so drastically when they check twice!
 
A83r/A94r – similar to vs MP the solver is a bit erratic here. As suggested, we want to just keep the strategy the same and just stab marginally wider.
 
General strategy – when checked to twice on double broadway turns/A high turns we bet really wide!
 
General notes – we're playing a very similar strategy, we just stab more often because when OOP checks twice their equity can't handle the pressure we can apply on their range.
 
 
After flop goes x/x and OOP stabs
 
T high boards and below – let's summarise these boards together for simplicity. Again we do a ton of stabbing on these low boards OTF (653fd for example we stab everything). This means that we don't often get to the turn this way, but if we do our range is relatively narrow.
 
There are some boards that we do have a small-ish xb range on, and that means we have some slowplays OTF, some airball xbs etc. Again our strategy is dependent on villain's turn size. If they bet big we rarely raise and if they bet small our raises are these slowplays. We can use 963rTd to see that even vs a 33% turn stab we are raising 27% of the time, but that's 4.3 combos (!!!!).
 
Summary – we stab so wide on T high flops that we don't really need to look at these. On the boards that we do x/b approx 35% on, we have raises vs smaller sizes and a lot less raises vs larger sizes. It's very easy to see what these raises are.
 
This is the simplification given in the BTN vs MP part of the module...
 
“Simplification - having looked through the remainder of these textures (and similar ones for comparison) I can confidently state that our strategy is the same on all the different types of boards. When the flop goes x/x and villain stabs turn we raise our turned strong hands, some combo draws at some frequency, and any slowplayed sets OTF. The wetter the texture, the less frequently we raise. When our opponent chooses 75% or 125% OTT we are raising so infrequently compared to a 33% or 50% size.”
 
Summary – stab really wide vs CO on T high flops (the lower the better)! When it's a board we're not stabbing relentlessly like KJ3r or A97r we have some slowplays in our range which means we can raise turn probes with these strong hands and any high equity bluffs. The bigger the size, the less we raise (we basically never raise an overbet), and the smaller the size, the more frequently we raise!
 
 
After villain xc's flop
 
The first thing we need to note is that vs MP we're only barreling around 50% of the time OTT. Vs CO the general consensus is that we barrel the lower cards at a much higher frequency, and bet the broadway cards the same amount. So if the flop is low and we stab really wide, we continue to barrel OTT more than we do vs MP on the lower cards.
 
The strategy is identical to the BTN vs MP part of the module. Quick recap – we use 33% on straight/flush completing cards, we use 75% on board pairing cards and middling cards (middling cards only applies to the low flops) and we use 125% on broadways (we're supposed to use 75% vs CO but let's keep it simple and overbet these broadway cards like we would vs MP). Interesting to note that we can overbet broadways when not the preflop aggressor but in a situation like BTN vs BB when we are the preflop aggressor we don't do any overbetting.
 
The only time we have a small bet after a big flop bet is on a low flush completing card (but that isze is still 75%  and not 33%). Even on straight completing turns if we bet big OTF we bet big OTT. QJ8fd is a perfect example of our sizing scheme.
 
When villain cbets flop and cbets turn or checks turn
 
T high flops
 
We shouldn't face any cbets OTF in these spots, but I wanted to point out the below...
 
As mentioned above our opponents will not follow the theory correctly and they will play some bets on some flops they shouldn't. It's tough for us to study this vs CO as the OOP player is supposed to check a ton. If we do face flop bets when we shouldn't we should treat it as if we were vs MP and play the same (i.e. some flop floats, a decent amount of raises with obvious hands). This means that we play the turn the same as we would vs MP. We have some slowplays in our range, we have some turned strong hands, and we have some high equity bluffs, so we can raise turn bets. The frequency we raise depends on the bet size.
 
If we do face a cbet on these flops and villain checks the turn to us we can see on T92r that we have a small probe size on low turns and a big probe size on big turns. Think “pocket 8s rule”.
 
Non T high flops
 
These are spots where we ARE supposed to face cbets OTF. We know that on boards like Q42, J76 etc we are supposed to face less cbets OTF, so let's look at some boards where villain is supposed to cbet.
 
KJ3r – as mentioned in the CO vs BTN section we can see that in theory OOP is supposed to bet 33% OTF and 33% again OTT. Nobody is doing this so as mentioned many times our raising frequencies are determined by our opponent's turn size. Again we have some flopped slowplays and some turned equity bluffs. Again, when checked to we play big bets only. Our betting range is really narrow and the pocket 8s rule applies so we prefer a larger size. Again we can see on A72r when checked to OTT we play a big sizing only.
 
There's a huge difference between the way we play A72r and K32r OTT with these middling hands. We rarely probe turn on A72r with our middling PPs/marginal hands but we probe really wide on K32r. I believe this is because 1) we want to protect from Ax rivers and 2) we can bluff wide with our one-overcard flop floats on K32r but obviously there is no such hand on A72r.
 
General strategy – people will over c-bet these flops CO vs BTN, so we need to have some slowplayed hands in our calling range. BTN vs MP these are low frequency sets but as we've seen we raise these almost always vs CO, so our slowplays become top-pair-good-kicker type hands. If we don't we can't raise our combo draws etc OTT. On T high flops and below when probing turn use a small size on bricks and a big size on big cards.  On boards with 2 high cards use a big size only when p robing. Note how much we should be checking back!
Hand Histories (WITH SOME MULTIWAYS!!!):


(0:46) vs Co Gazzy has 7♣7♠ on the BTN 
Flop: 8♦6♠2♥ (8.5 BB). Co checks. Gazzy bets 33% and CO calls .
Good flop check by CO. On boards T-high or below CO should basically check his entire range.Btn in this position should use a 33% stab size with a fairly wide range. 
Turn: 2♣ (14 BB). Both players check
Btn on this turn should mainly be betting a polarized range using a larger bet-sizing strategy
River: 7♦ (14 BB). Co bets ~75% pot. Gazzy raises 3x. Co shoves and Gazzy calls. CO wins with 8♥8♠
(6:13) Gazzy has Q♥K♥ in MP vs Btn 
Flop: K♠Q♣4♦ (6.5 BB). Gazzy bets 33% and Btn calls.
This is a good flop for mp and in this spot we should be betting about 75% of the time. Hands with no equity like 76 or A6 no bdfd make up the bulk of our checking range.
Turn: 7♣ (10.5 BB). Gazzy bets 125% pot and Btn calls.
Gazzy points out that this overbet is a mistake and solver prefers to bet small again on the turn as MP.
River: T♦ (40 BB). Gazzy bets ~75% pot. Btn calls and wins with 7♥7♠
To recap, Gazzy prefers to use a small single-sizing strategy on flop and turn, but on some rivers he likes to split his range into 2-size (big/small bet) strategy. A river T is a better board for a single-sizing strategy.
(13:30) Vs MP Gazzy has  K♦Q♦ on the Btn 
Flop: 6♥3♣3♥ (6 BB). MP bets 75%. Gazzy calls.
Good sizing by MP. As Btn solver calls with KQ bdfd half the time. However, this is a marginal call and Gazzy prefers to just fold in-game. Against a smaller sizing this combo is definitely a call. 
Turn: K♣ (14.5 BB). MP bets ~75%. Gazzy calls.
This is a good card for MP’s range that he should be barrelling at a high frequency. Gazzy has an easy turn call going into the river. 
River: 4♦ (40 BB). MP bets ~75% pot. Gazzy calls and wins against  Q♣J♣
Well played by both players here. MP should bet this river with a wide range of bluffs. 
(18:20) Multiway Hand: Gazzy is in the Co with  A♣7♣ vs Btn and BB 
Flop: K♥2♣T♦ (8 BB). All players check.
Heads-up this is a really good flop for CO’s range and solver suggests betting really wide.In multiway pots Gazzy recommends generally betting 50% pot with a narrower range. This hand isn’t strong enough to bet in this case.
Turn: 6♣ (8 BB). BB bets ~33% pot. Gazzy raises 3x. Btn folds and BB calls
River: 2♥ (26 BB). Gazzy bets ~120% pot. BB calls and wins with 6♥6♦
On this river Gazzy thinks it’s best to mostly overbet using a polarized range. It’s not ideal to have flush blockers, but there aren’t enough natural bluffs Gazzy can have to not overbet here.
(29:35) Multiway: Gazzy is in the Co with  6♠6♥ vs Btn and BB
Flop: 7♥5♦3♦ (8 BB). Gazzy bets 50% pot. Btn calls and BB folds.
(Gazzy prefaces the action stating that he “absolutely butchered” this hand)  
Vs Btn solver recommends checking 100% of the time on this board. Gazzy thinks CO might want to have some bluffs here multiway, however, betting 66 here is still an obvious mistake.
Turn: 2♠ (16 BB). Gazzy checks. Btn bets ~pot. Gazzy calls
No way to put it other than this is a disaster of a turn call. 
River: 6♦ (45 BB). Both players check and Gazzy wins against 8♦8♣
Gazzy prefers Btn bet 75% on the turn rather than pot, but otherwise well played.
(32:00) Vs Co Gazzy has K♣J♣ on the Btn
Flop: 2♦3♦K♥ (6 BB). Co checks. Gazzy bets 66%. Co calls. 
Co should bet fairly often here using a 33% pot sizing strategy. Gazzy would have preferred to have seen himself bet 33% pot here rather than 66%. 
Turn: 4♣ (16 BB). Co checks. Gazzy bets 75% pot. Co calls. 
On this turn the solver checks more than half the time while using a strictly overbet sizing when betting. This KJ combo with a fd overbets ~80% of the time while all other KJ combos mostly check.
River: 7♠ (38 BB). Both players check. Gazzy wins against A♦Q♦
(38:00) Vs MP Gazzy has Q♥ J♥ on the Btn
Flop: 9♠7♥J♣ (4.5 BB). MP checks. Gazzy bets 33% pot. MP calls
This is one of the boards where MP will need to check upwards of 75% of the time. When MP does bet he should stick to a smaller sizing. Btn should stick to stabbing with a 33% sizing when checked to. This QJ combos mixes between stabbing and checking back
Turn: 7♦ (9 BB). Both players check. 
QJ makes a good check on the flop because it’s Btn’s weakest top pair. The same logic largely applies to this turn 
River: 4♠ (9 BB). MP checks. Gazzy bets 75%. MP calls and loses with A♥6♥
(43:10) Multiway: Gazzy has J♠8♠ in MP vs Btn and BB
Flop: 2♣Q♠2♦ (8 BB). All players check
Gazzy’s hand doesn’t have enough equity to bet here.Hands like KJ or JTss make up the bottom of MP’s betting range in this spot multiway. 
Turn: 4♣ (8 BB). Gazzy bets 75% pot. Btn calls and BB folds 
MP’s prefer bet sizing in this spot is 75% pot. J8 no fd should still check but Ax wheel draw combos and other turned draws make for good bluffing candidates in this spot. Gazzy notes that this bet was another big mistake.
River: K♦ (19.5 BB). Gazzy bets 75% pot. Btn folds.
Arriving at the river this way, Gazzy thinks he is pretty much forced to bet here. The solver likely prefers different sizings based on the runout, but in this case 75% pot makes the most sense. On cards like a 5 the solver is going to want to incorporate some overbets with a more polarized range.
(47:10) Multiway: Gazzy has Q♠Q♥ in Co vs Btn and BB
Flop: 8♥T♥K♣ (8 BB). All players check
QQ is a clear check for Co multiway here.
Turn: 2♦ (8 BB). All players check
Gazzy thinks it’s best to split between betting and checking on this turn.
River: 4♦ (8 BB). Gazzy bets 75% pot. Btn calls and loses with J♦T♦.
Clear bet for QQ on this river with 75% pot being a good standard sizing.










Rule #1: Increase your preflop raise size when there is a weak player in the blinds.
The main goal for this adjustment is extracting more value from the weak player. Weak and inexperienced players tend to call raises with the same range of hands, regardless of size (known as a ‘static’ calling range).
If the weak player will call with the same range of hands versus a 3.5bb raise as they would versus a 2.5bb raise, you should opt for the former because it will allow you to win more money (on average).
bb = big blinds
________________


Rule #2: 3-bet larger preflop when you will be out of position postflop.
You should 3-bet around three times your opponent’s raise size when you are in position and around four times your opponent’s raise size when you are out of position
When you are out of position, your opponent will realize his equity much more easily, which means you should size up your 3-bets. By contrast, you generally want to use a smaller 3-bet sizes in position because you want to put your opponent in a tough spot (facing a well-sized 3-bet out of position) with his medium strength hands.
________________


Rule #3: Bet small (25-35% pot) on dry, static board textures
As well as functioning to get value, bets on the flop and turn deny your opponents their equity when they fold. In other words, you take away their chance of winning the pot by forcing them to fold with a bet.
When equity denial is not important, you are more incentivized to use small bet sizes. This is often the case on dry boards because most of your opponent’s hands will have little-to-no equity against your value betting range.
Another benefit of using a small bet size on dry boards is that calling ranges tend to be inelastic. Phrased differently: the likelihood that your opponent folds to a bet will be similar regardless of bet size. Why risk betting large with your bluffs when you can get the same result with a smaller bet?
Additionally, small bet sizes work well as an exploitative adjustment against players that fold too often. This is particularly true in live games and weak online environments where many opponents often play a ‘fit or fold’ postflop style.
Here’s a hand played by an Upswing Lab member that demonstrates this concept:
Online Cash 6-Handed. 100bb Effective Stacks.
Hero is dealt 6♦ 5♦ in the CO.
UTG folds. MP folds. Hero raises to 2.5bb. BTN folds. SB folds. BB calls.
Flop (5.5bb): A♦ 8♠ 3♣
BB checks. Hero bets 1.8bb. BB folds.
Analysis from Doug
On a dry board like A♦ 8♠ 3♣, a small bet size (33% in this example) makes the most sense. This is because our range of value hands (88, 33, A8s, A3s, AK, AQ, etc) is unlikely to be outdrawn on the turn, so we aren’t as incentivized to drive out our opponent’s equity with a larger bet.
In the equity calculation below, we can see just how little equity the BB’s range has versus our value betting range:
 bet size poker equity 

The BB’s estimated range has just 11.32% equity
And this chart shows how much equity each hand in the BB’s range has versus our value betting range (does not include our bluffs):
 bet size range breakdown 

The overwhelming majority of the BB’s range poses very little threat to our value bets
Also, the BB’s calling range is likely to be inelastic in this spot. Hands like QJo and 65s will usually be folded regardless of the bet size because such hands have terrible playability on later streets. Not to mention they are drawing nearly dead against our value hands.
________________


Rule #4: Bet pretty large (55-80% pot) on wet, dynamic board textures
When your value betting range is vulnerable to being outdrawn, you should use a larger bet size. This strategy has three notable benefits:
1. Large bet sizes allow you to build the pot when you have a strong hand.
2. Larger bets extract more value before the turn or river has a chance to reduce your strong hand to a bluff-catcher.
For instance, almost half of the deck is a bad card for 9♣ 9♦ on T♥ 9♥ 5♠ 4♠.
3. Large bet sizes generate more fold equity, making your bluffs more effective
For example, this hand was played by John C. and analyzed by Doug in the private Upswing Lab group:
Online Cash 6-Handed. 100bb Effective Stacks.
Hero is dealt A♣ A♥ on the BTN.
UTG raises to 3bb. MP calls. CO folds. Hero raises to 11bb. SB folds. BB folds. UTG calls. MP calls.
Flop (34.5bb): 2♠ 5♥ 3♠
UTG checks. MP checks. Hero bets 12bb. UTG calls. MP calls.
Turn (70.5bb): 8♣
UTG checks. MP checks. Hero bets 22.32bb. UTG folds. MP calls.
River (115.14bb): 6♥
MP checks. Hero…?
Analysis from Doug
This ~33% flop bet size is too small given the board texture and stack-to-pot ratio. The board is low, but it is not static – our opponents can have a variety of flush draws and backdoor draws.
Our stack depth is another reason to large bet on this flop. If we bet 22bb (65% pot-size bet) and get called by one player, we will take a turn card with 78.5bb in the pot and 67bb behind. This stack-to-pot ratio allows us to comfortably shove on the turn (more on this in rule #5).
When we use a flop bet size that allows us to go all-in on the turn, our bluffs will generate more fold equity and our opponents won’t have a great price to draw.
It’s worth noting that checking on this flop would also be a reasonable play with aces.
________________


Rule #5: The stack-to-pot ratio should influence your bet size
Your stack-to-pot ratio (SPR) is an important factor to consider when choosing a bet size.
You have to think ahead, considering what the size of the pot will be on later streets and how you intend to proceed with your value hands and bluffs.
Many players will bet too large on the flop and turn, and as a result end up with a tiny bet left behind on the river. Bluffing is extremely ineffective in such situations because tiny river shoves generate little-to-no fold equity, which is not a desirable situation.
This example hand was played and submitted by Upswing Lab member Bogdan E.:
150/300 Live Tournament 9-Handed. 21,000 Effective Stacks.
Hero is dealt Q♥ Q♦ on the BTN.
UTG calls. UTG+1 calls. LJ calls. HJ folds. CO folds. Hero raises to 1,200. SB folds. BB calls. UTG+1 calls. LJ calls.
Flop (5,250): 3♠ 6♣ 9♥
BB checks. UTG+1 checks. LJ checks. Hero bets 3,000. BB folds. UTG+1 calls. LJ folds.
Turn (11,250): J♦
UTG+1 checks. Hero bets 7,000. UTG+1 raises to 15,000. Hero raises to 16,800 and is all-in. UTG+1 calls and shows 6d6h.
River (44,850): 5♣
Analysis from Doug
The first sizing error in this hand is the preflop raise — somewhere between 1,800 and 2,000 chips would have been better. With three limpers already in the pot, we need to raise to a size that doesn’t give our opponents such a good price to call.
Raising to a bigger size is particularly important with the hand we have, QQ, since high pocket pairs perform better with a low SPR and when fewer players see the flop.
Assuming we make it 1,800 and get the same number of callers, the pot on the flop will be 7,650 with 19,200 behind. Considering our SPR, using a size of around 5,000 (~65% pot) on the flop sets us up nicely for a shove on the turn — 14,200 into 17,650 assuming one caller (~80% pot).
This approach allows us to extract maximum value with our strong hands whilst ensuring we generate good fold equity with our bluffs (like QTs).
The larger sizes Bogdan actually used on the flop and turn will often times lead to an awkward spot on the river. Had our opponent not check-raised on the turn, we would have reached the river with less than a half-pot size bet behind (~10,000 into ~25,000) which is not ideal for our triple-barrel bluffs.
________________


Rule #6: Overbet when you have a nut advantage
Overbets work well on boards that favor your range over your opponent’s range, particularly when only you are able to have the stongest hands.
An overbetting range should also be polarized, made up of only strong hands and bluffs. Using such a large size allows you to get the maximum with your value hands, and generate maximum fold equity with our bluffs.
The most effective overbet bluffs are usually hands that block our opponent’s most likely strong hands that will call. The best example of this is using the nut flush blocker on a three-to-a-flush board (think A♦ K♠ on Q♦ 8♦ 2♣ 6♦ 3♠).
This hand was played by Doug and self-analyzed in his overbet module in the Upswing Lab:
$100/$200 Heads-Up. $59,416 Effective Stacks.
Doug is dealt 4♦ 2♦ in the BB.
BTN raises to $700. Doug calls.
Flop ($1,400): 5♠ A♥ Q♦
Doug checks. BTN bets $980. Doug calls.
Turn ($3,360): 3♣
Doug checks. BTN checks.
River ($3,360): 7♦
Doug checks. BTN bets $1,500. Doug raises to $10,800. BTN calls and mucks A♠ 2♥.
Analysis from Doug
We can make some assumptions about the button’s range once he checks the turn:
   1. The button does not have the turned nuts (42) because that hand would almost certainly value bet on the turn.
   2. The button does not have the rivered nuts (64) because a 6-high draw would almost certainly semi-bluff on the turn.
   3. The sets and two pairs in the button’s preflop range (AA, QQ, 55, AQ, A5) are unlikely to have been played this way.
Since our opponent is very unlikely to have a nutted hand on this river, we can construct an overbetting strategy. Here is how we will divvy up our value range on the river:
Check-raise huge with our strongest hands (64, 42, 55, 33)
Overbet check-raising here allows us to extract an extra bet from our opponent’s bluffs, and get maximum value when our opponent bets-calls with a value hand (like the A2o here).
We also need to mix in some bluff check-raises here in order to balance out our value bets. 54 is a perfect candidate because it blocks set combos (55), two-pair combos (A5, Q5, 53) and straight combos (42 and 64).
The size of our check-raise in this spot should always be large (at least 2x pot) because we are representing a polarized range.
Overbet lead with the rest of our value hands (35, A5, A3, A7, some Ax)
We can then overbet lead with our medium-to-strong hands, which prevents our opponent from checking back for free on the river.
________________


Rule #7: Bet at least 66% pot on the turn when firing the second continuation bet
The most important concept to keep in mind for playing on the turn is polarization. You want your betting range to be comprised of hands that will be able to value bet on the river very often and hands that have a decent chance to improve to the best hand on the river.
Middling hands, which are typically included in small betting ranges, should be checked for the following reasons:
   * If the turn checks through, middling hands will be strong enough to bet on the river for value.
   * You can use middling hands to catch your opponent’s bluffs on the river.
   * Middling hands protect the weak showdown value hands (such as A/K-high) with which you would also check.
   * Including middling hands in your turn checking range will allow you to credibly bluff with very weak hands on the river.
This way, all your hands work symbiotically to maximize the expected value (EV) of your whole strategy.
Because you are using a polarized strategy, your bet size should be bigger in order to extract maximum value with your strong hands and to increase the frequency at which you can bluff. Using anything less than 66% in the vast majority of cases will just lower your overall EV.
________________


Rule #8: You should usually c-bet between 25-40% of the pot in 3-bet pots
This is tied to rule #5.
Because the stack-to-pot ratio is so low in 3-bet pots, you can put all your stack in on the river with under pot sized bets, even if you start with a very low c-bet size. Furthermore, this bet size is also the one that solvers prefers both in position and out of position.
Given the ranges involved a small bet usually puts enough pressure on the middling part of your villain’s hands (make him have a hard time with them).
Should You Ever Bluff with a Pair?
 Should You Ever Bluff with a Pair? 

Turning a made hand into a bluff might initially sound counterintuitive. In the pre-solver days, holding a weak pair was often associated with checking, “We don’t want to bloat the pot and are happy to reach a cheap showdown” was a common saying. Solvers helped us understand that betting weak pairs outperforms checking in some situations. The line between randomly betting pairs and precisely knowing what you are doing can be blurry. But fear not! In this article, you will learn everything you need to successfully grasp the concepts of bluffing pairs in cash games to outplay your opponents.
The Logic Behind Turning Pairs → Bluffs
Before diving into the practical examples, we need to know a few theoretical things.
When we look at solver outputs on the river, we frequently see that we are not just bluffing our air but are also supposed to use some of our pairs. The solver calculates:
   * The EV of pure bluffing: EV (Bluff) = (Fold% × (Pot)) – (Defend% × (Bet))
   * The EV of checking as the IP player: (EQ of hand) × (Pot)
(OOP is slightly more complicated because we are not closing the action.)
The calculated EV helps us to understand how all of the possible actions perform on the river.
 gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 1 gto 

On earlier streets, however, multiple merged motives can sometimes encourage us to take the aggressive line with some of our weak pairs.
To clarify, a solver does not “think” as a human would; it’s an EV-maximizing algorithm that calculates the best strategies given the inputs that were provided. By comparing solver outputs, we can recognize repeating patterns for which we can build heurístics that make all of this output easier to understand and more practical to use in-game.
The Dos and Don’ts
Turning pairs into a bluff can be tricky. Often, minor differences draw the line between an excellent play and a spew. But there is good news! This is not just solver noise. Every strange-looking play is made for a reason. The more we understand how ranges interact with board textures and potential runouts, the easier it becomes. To uncover the different motives for sometimes taking the aggressive route with our weak pairs and acquire the ability to spot the difference between randomly clicking buttons and thoughtful plays, we will inspect some realistic examples to better grasp when and why to turn pairs into bluffs.
Bluffing Pairs in Single-Raised Pots
We usually want to keep the pot small with marginal holdings, especially when we are out of position (OOP). There are situations, though, where we want to check/raise some of our weak pairs. To give you a better insight, let us explore the following spot:
 gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 2 

BB response (filtered for suited 4-x) vs BTN’s 33% pot c-bet on K84r: NL500, 100bb starting
As we can see, our bottom pairs, especially the ones with the lowest kickers, get checked/raised around 20% of the time here. But why is that? Let’s take a closer look at the BTN response to find out:
 gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 3 

BTN response vs BB’s 100% pot check/raise
There are a couple of prominent indicators to be identified in the BTN’s response:
      * The BTN is starting to fold better pairs, such as 55–77, some 8-x, and even a tiny percentage of their weakest top pairs. IP is folding a massive number of two live overcards to the four, which results in an immense amount of EQ denial. At the same time, the BTN is floating with their best backdoor hands. So, the effect is of a merged nature; we get some better hands to fold and a few worse hands to call (or fold).
      * The BB blocks a decent amount of IP’s best hands when holding a four while having five outs to outdraw their higher pairs.
      * IP is folding a lot of Ten-x, Jack-x, and Queen-x, so OOP prefers to check/raise 4-x that unblock those hands by not holding one of these three cards. Hands like Q4 block more of IP’s folding range than hands like 43. Another motive is the risk of coolers for OOP increases when holding Q4 instead of 43. IP has significantly more KQ and QQ combos they continue with compared to 33 and K3 because IP doesn’t have any K3o in his range and folds all 33 combos versus the check/raise.
      * In this situation, one exception is low pairs with an overcard to the top pair, A4. A4 benefits from check/raising since it can outdraw current nutted two pairs and cooler Ace-x when an Ace turns up.
Getting a clearer picture of how to play the flop is already great, but future streets are often still shrouded in a fog of war. Countless different runouts can make it feel complicated to locate the signal of when and why to keep betting our weak pairs. Let us examine how and how not to keep betting our weakest pairs on future runouts together.
When To Keep Bluffing With Pairs

———
↓ BTN response vs BB’s 125% pot turn barrel
 gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 5 

We take a turn onto a bricky 2. The sim tells us to keep the pressure on with almost 80% of BB’s 4-x. Some motives are pretty similar to the flop, but a few differ.
      * The first two reasons overlap with the ones on the flop: The BTN folds many better pairs:
•
All pocket pairs below the King fold purely.
•
The vast majority of second pairs (68.4%), and even a considerable number of top pairs (34.9%). (BB also denies a significant amount of EQ from all BTN’s flop floats that are now pure folding on the turn.)
      * The noticeable difference is that the BB is running out of bluffs. All the BDSD and BDFD combos between the 8 and the King are giving up pure because of poor blocker properties and no chance to improve to even outdraw a top pair King. The BB’s 4-x combos are getting forced into becoming bluffs. The fact that the BTN doesn’t continue with worse hands, except for a minimal amount of gutshots around the low end of the board, is also an indication that they’re now considered bluffs. Third pair (4-x) is now betting for less merged motives; they become almost pure polar bluffs.
The river doesn’t change much on almost all runouts, except for the worst ones (King and 8); the BB is turning a substantial amount of 4-x into bluffs.
 gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 6 

BB first-in river strategy (filter: 4-x) vs BTN on K842r 2 (after flop = X-B33-R100-C, turn = B125-C)
While the BB’s reasons for check/raising some of their small pairs started out merged on the flop, the motives cleared up as the hand progressed through the streets to the river. Blocking a substantial amount of BTN´s strong hands and running out of natural bluffs while at the bottom of their range are the leading drivers for the BB to complete the conversion of 4-x into a bluff on the river in this spot.
When To Stop Bluffing With Pairs
In some scenarios, we don’t want to follow through with our weak pairs. To gain a more detailed understanding, let’s explore the following spot.
 gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 7 

BB first-in river strategy (filter: 4-x) vs BTN on K8422 double FD brick (after flop = X-B33-R100-C, turn = B125-C)
Did you notice a difference regarding the board texture from the prior spot? At first, it seems there is only a small one, right? The suits changed, but that´s about it. The strategy for OOP’s 4-x massively differs, though.
All of BB’s 4-x is now pure checking the river. Let us find out why!
      * We see something worth noticing if we examine the EQ of BB’s 4-x on the river. They have roughly twice the amount of EQ compared to the spot before. The reason is pretty simple: The BTN has lots of bricked flush draws. So, the BB can beat some of villain’s range at showdown with all their 4-x. OOP collects enough EV (i.e., showdown value) to make check the max EV action.
      * The BTN has a lot of bricked flush draws, but so does the BB, right? In the spot prior, the BB was running out of natural bluffs and was at the bottom of range when holding a single pair of fours. The BB can now choose bluffs from all their bricked flush draws they check/raised and barreled turn with.
To summarize the key learning so far:
There are sometimes merged motives for betting low pairs on the flop and turn, despite having enough showdown value and other bluffs to choose from.
The main merged motives for low pairs are:
      * Folding out better hands (pairs).
      * Denying EQ while getting called by worse hands (draws).
Those merge-bets with low pairs happen even more frequently when in position because the IP player can realize more EQ by always being able to check back the river on runouts where they don’t need to turn their weak pairs into a bluff.
As we can see, minor differences in board texture can cause major differences in strategy. Keeping an eye on how ranges look across all streets will help you maneuver through these spots more efficiently.
Bluffing Pairs in 3-Bet Pots
Turning pairs into a bluff is not just happening in SRPs. Let us explore the following two spots together to help you understand when and when not to bluff pairs in 3-bet pots!
When To Bluff With Pairs
 gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 8 

BTN river strategy vs CO on AK48T (with flop = X-B33-C, turn = X-B75-C): NL500, 100bb starting)
When we examine the river output more closely, we will instantly notice that the BTN is bluffing with a decent amount of third and worse pairs (roughly 62%). There are a few reasons:
      * BTN’s lowest pairs have almost no showdown value.
      * Hands such as JT and QT have good removal effects since they don’t block any snap-folds and also block rivered two pairs the CO is pure calling the river with. Even though they win more at showdown compared to the lowest pocket pairs, it’s only by a marginal amount—they only have 5–7% EQ themselves.
      * IP is running out of natural bluffs. Hands such as QJ/QT and JT that were gutshots on the turn rivered a straight or a pair. There are only very few busted draws in the BTN’s range. In particular, the lowest pairs with pure unblocker properties are now forced to turn themselves into a bluff. When we modify the river to a brick (that doesn’t change the nuts) like a deuce, we see that most of the BTN’s low pairs are checking back.
      * Ranges become very tight on the river. Blocker effects matter way more now. Having removal of a couple of strong hands in villain’s range already or blocking some of the snap-folds already has an enormous impact on their calling/folding ranges. A hand such as Q♦9♦ gives up pure while QT is bluffing pure, even though Q9 has less showdown value (roughly 5% less EQ). Q9 in diamonds blocks several snap-folds while JT has removal to a bunch of strong hands.
Notice that the same reasons to bluff low pairs return:
      * The low pairs are weak, they have low showdown value.
      * Favorable blocker effects.
      * The player runs out of natural bluffs.
Before we explore when not to bluff pairs in 3-bet pots, let’s test our understanding of ranges and how this impacts our strategy!
 gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 9 

The EV of all given options to the BTN for JTs on the river
Question: J♠T♠ makes more money than J♥T♥ and even more than double the amount of J♦T♦ for the shoving option. Why is that?
Reveal Answer
You can use this knowledge to your advantage. In spots where you suspect that your opponent will call slightly lighter than he is supposed to, we can simplify and purely give up with our worst-performing pairs that are indifferent at equilibrium.
When you struggle with finding the motives why a particular combo gets chosen over another for a particular action, a closer look at the following two things will help you.
      * Exploring the trash and value removal scores at the top left of each combo.
      * Examine your opponent’s response versus your strategy.
When Not To Bluff With Pairs
 gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 10 

BTN river strategy vs CO on JT523 (with flop = X-B33-C, turn = X-B75-C): NL500, 100bb starting)
When we compare the previous spot with this one, we will spot a big difference regarding the bluffing combos: The BTN is not bluffing with a single pair on the river, but why?
      * Even the worst pairs, such as A3s have almost 16% EQ, way more than the worst pairs in the spot before. The CO has a lot of bricked draws in range, enough that even the worst pairs in CO’s range win more than 15% of the time.
      * The BTN is not running out of natural bluffs. IP has plenty of combos with acceptable or good blocker properties, such as all busted straight draws and Ace-highs, except those with spades. All of them have much worse showdown value compared to the low pairs.
In spots where a player has lots of natural bluffs with good blocker properties and very little showdown value to choose from on the river, they often won’t need to turn weak pairs into a bluff.
The Influence of Position
Positions play a prominent role in how you construct your strategy. Let’s jump into the following spot to understand more deeply what influence positions have on bluffing pairs.
 gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 11 

↑ BTN river strategy (filter: low pair) vs BB on JT36A flush-completing in an SRP (with flop = X-B50-C, turn = X-X)
———
↓ UTG river strategy (filter: low pair) vs BB (same board (runout) and action)
 gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 12 

Both spots are very similar, with the same flop sizing and turn check, on the same board. The only visible difference is the position. The IP player in the left picture opened from UTG, and the IP player on the right opened from the BTN. When we note the worst pairs of the IP player, we notice that the BTN checks them 100% of the time, while the UTG player turns them into a bluff almost 40% of the time. There are the following reasons:
      * The BB’s postflop defense is much wider versus the BTN compared to the one versus UTG. This means the lowest pairs of the BTN have way more EQ and showdown value compared to UTG. Looking at the EQ of the weakest pairs in both outputs confirms that. All pocket 99 and lower pairs of UTG have 0% EQ, while those same hands of BTN retain between 8–25% EQ.
      * The postflop defending ranges differ greatly depending on the position, but so do the preflop opening ranges. While the UTG player lacks a lot of natural bluffs in his range, such as all the seven to King-high combos, the BTN has far more natural bluffs to choose from.
As we can see, position is a very influential factor in the process of answering the questions of when and why to bluff pairs. In the end, though, it all comes down to how well you understand the composition of ranges and their interaction with board textures. Constantly improving this skill will help you to outperform and outplay your opponents in the long run.
When We Want to Deviate
Against weaker opponents who deviate themselves (often unintentionally), we want to adjust our strategy as well—from the default, GTO game plan to a custom-tailored, exploitative one. To illustrate how to adapt when it comes to turning pairs into bluffs, let us do a little experiment and take the previous BB vs BTN spot on JT36A flush-completing river but with a little twist.
In theory, the BB can only fold slightly over 50% of their third and worse pairs against a 67% pot river-bet in this spot.
Now, let us imagine we play at our local casino and face a tighter player who folds all their third pairs and worse on the river. How do we want to adjust?

↓ BTN exploitative river strategy (filter: low pair) vs BB (same board (runout), same action): nodelocked BB response (folding 100% of all third pairs and worse)
 gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 14 

      * When we look at our default (GTO) strategy, we see that all low pairs always check on the river. They have enough showdown value, and the BTN has so much air to choose from that we don’t even consider bluffing them. They are “too high up in our range.”
      * Even though the above reasons also apply, when we examine the nodelocked (exploitative) solution, we notice a massive difference. The BTN is turning 100% of their low pairs into bluffs. Comparing the EV of BTN’s low pairs shows us how drastic the impact of BB’s heavy over-folding is:

The EV of all given options to the BTN for 55 on the river: GTO (↖), Exploitative (↗)
Depending on the combo, the EV of bluffing for all low pairs increases between 250 and even over 400%. An outcome like this is not even unrealistic when we face a very tight player. As we can see, turning pairs into a bluff that would usually always take a showdown can be highly profitable. Keeping an eye on the player type you are facing, understanding what you and your opponent are supposed to do, and being able to adjust accordingly will skyrocket your win rate.
Conclusion
Uff, this was a lot of information to process! Let us go over the most critical points again.
      * While the motive for betting low pairs on the river is primarily driven by folding out better ones, betting low pairs on earlier streets often involves merged motives. The main reasons are to fold out better made hands and deny EQ while getting called by worse hands (typically draws). Merged betting with low pairs happens more often when we are IP due to higher EQR.
      * In river spots where we have many natural bluffs with good blocker properties and very little showdown value to choose from, turning our low pairs into a bluff is often overkill.
      * Don’t gloss over seemingly small differences in board texture. They can significantly impact optimal strategies.
      * When you are not sure why a particular combo gets chosen over another, inspect the trash and value removal scores at the top-left of each hand combination and how your opponent will respond versus your strategy. It will help you to maneuver through the hands more confidently.
      * Understanding the composition of ranges and their interaction with board textures is the key to outplaying your opponents in the long run.
      * Adapting to the mistakes of our opposing players will make the difference between being a slight or massive winner.

We’re At The River. Our Hand Can’t Win. Now What?
 We’re At The River. Our Hand Can’t Win. Now What? 

You’re in a heads-up pot and you’ve made it to the river. Your opponent has check/called two streets, so you’re relatively confident their range is at least somewhat capped. There’s just one problem; you have a really weak hand that can’t win the pot without bluffing.
How do you figure out whether you should bluff or give up, when you have no information about how your opponent plays?
While this can be a very tricky spot to navigate, especially in larger pots, there are plenty of theoretical concepts we can call upon to help us with this kind of decision. Let’s explore a few of the most important things we should be keeping in mind when we arrive at the river with a potential bluffing candidate.
Theoretical concerns:
      * Showdown value
      * Blockers
      * Unblockers
      * Frequencies
 Multiway strategy in Progressive Knockout Tournaments 

Showdown Value
First and foremost, we have to evaluate whether the idea that our hand can’t win at showdown is actually accurate. After all, there are plenty of scenarios where a hand that was bluffing on one or even both previous streets still has 5%, 10%, or even 20% equity once the river rolls off.
Example
Take this spot as an example—it’s based on a recent online hand I played. It’s an MTT spot where we open A♦K♠ from the LJ at an 8-handed table and get called by the SB, with effective stacks of roughly 30bb. I’ve used Chip EV ranges here, just to illustrate the principles at work.
The flop comes T43 with two clubs, villain checks, we c-bet 40% pot, and villain calls. The turn is an offsuit Queen, villain checks, and we bet again for a roughly geometric size of around 70% pot. villain calls, and the river comes an offsuit 7.
 We’re At The River. Our Hand Can’t Win. Now What? 

The postflop action
We could think about bluffing here, given that we only have Ace-high, and we can put a lot of pressure on a hand like JTs or T9s, which would be a pure bluff-catcher here. However, before we bluff with this hand (and remember, in theory, bluffing the river is usually a 0EV proposition unless we have some very important blockers), we should make sure to evaluate whether it’s possible we can actually win at showdown because:
If we know that checking makes money, then making a theoretically break-even bluff on the river is actually a bad play.
 We’re At The River. Our Hand Can’t Win. Now What? 

LJ’s river strategy with AKo vs SB
As you can see here, any combo of AKo that reaches the river in this line wins 21%–30% of the pot by checking, given that we beat all of villain’s missed flush draws and combo draws. So, even though bluff-shoving would be winning around 15% of the pot at the bare minimum here, that’s not enough to justify actually making the play.
If we’re going to make sure we have enough bluffs here to keep villain indifferent, which is what we should be doing in theory, then there’s no reason to take a hand that can sometimes win at showdown and use it as a bluff. We may as well use hands that never win at showdown instead, and this way we’re not giving up whatever percentage of the pot we might be winning if we check.
 We’re At The River. Our Hand Can’t Win. Now What? 

LJ’s river strategy with 98s vs SB
By contrast, here’s a look at the EV of betting vs checking when we have 98s—clearly, this is a big difference. While minor card removal factors related to the turn being the Q♥ do make 9♦8♦ a better bluff than 9♥8♥ here, we’re bluffing 9♥8♥ 100% of the time, even though it’s only winning 8.6% of the pot by doing so. This is specifically because we’re only making 2% of the pot if we check since it’s so difficult for the villain to ever have worse than 9-high.
Of course, there are plenty of spots where even Ace-high has no showdown value at all, based on the nature of the board texture and the opponent’s range for continuing beyond the turn; in those spots, bluffing the river with Ace-high will usually be a much more reasonable proposition. But you’d be surprised how many errors players will make by bluffing with hands that simply don’t need to bluff in order to sometimes be able to win.
Blockers and Unblockers
A lot is made of the significance of blockers within poker strategy, and in many cases, they’re not as meaningful as you might think, but bluffing the river is one instance where it is important to be mindful of each individual hand’s blocking and unblocking properties.
As a rule of thumb, if we’re planning to bluff the river, we want our hand to do two things:
      * Block at least some of the hands our opponent is likely to call with
      * Unblock as many folding hands as possible, or in other words, not blocking any of the folding range
While it’s not easy to find spots where a hand does both of these, it does occur surprisingly often, and these are spots where we should make sure we pull the trigger on bluffs.
There are also plenty of spots where our hand will be able to do one of the above, but not the other, and bluffing with these hands is generally going to be pretty reasonable as well.
The spots we want to avoid, however, are the ones where our hand does neither of the two things we want—it doesn’t block any calling hands, and it actually does block some of our opponent’s folding range.
In these spots, our bluff is significantly less likely to get through. The best way to explore these spots with GTO Wizard is by using the “Blockers” tab in the analysis section of a sim. The first clues can be found in the “Hands” tab however. Let’s go back to our previous example so I can show you what I mean.
 We’re At The River. Our Hand Can’t Win. Now What? 

LJ’s river strategy with AKo vs SB
Here are all of our AKo combos from the spot we were looking at before. The blocker scores are represented in the top-left of each rectangle, next to the hands themselves. The left number is the value removal, while the right one is the trash removal.
Value Removal Score
When using these scores to guide us, it’s important to note that since value removal only really refers to the top portion of our opponent’s range and not their bluff-catchers, most of our bluffing candidates in many spots will have relatively low value removal scores. Even a 2 or a 3 can be a significant factor in some scenarios. All the AKo combos have a 1 in this particular spot because they don’t block any two pairs, sets, or straights.
Trash Removal Score
However, the trash removal scores are going to vary significantly, depending on certain hands’ interaction with all the weakest combos in our opponent’s range. In this particular spot, a combo like A♦K♠ doesn’t block any of the weakest hands in villain’s range, which are mostly missed flush draws, so it has a 1 for trash removal; something like A♣K♥, though, has a 6 for trash removal, because the A♣ blocks all the missed nut flush draws.
When In-Game
We can’t necessarily expect ourselves to calculate these removal scores in a precise way in-game, but looking at the scores in the sims we study away from the tables helps us to acknowledge why a certain hand might be choosing whether or not to bluff in a specific spot. This process cultivates the intuition that we rely upon when sitting at a table where it’s brain vs brain.
Frequencies
Our final theoretical concern in these spots is our overall bluffing frequency. While we won’t always be up against opponents who are capable of recognizing whether we’re over-bluffing or under-bluffing, we do have to be mindful of:
      * The information we convey to everyone else at the table when hands go to showdown.
      * The way our bluffing choices on the river will affect the way our opponents perceive us over time.
If we automatically bluff the river with every possible bluffing candidate, we’re likely going to end up over-bluffing, which may actually be a short-term benefit in many spots, but could leave us open to a very obvious counterexploit by any competent and attentive opponent at the table—they simply stop folding their bluff-catchers. Conversely, if we don’t bluff the river even with our best candidates, those competent opponents can make the inverse adjustment relatively easily; folding to our river-bets more often.
While it might be tempting to dive down the rabbit hole of deliberately trying to influence our opponents’ future adaptations with our current actions, it’s a very difficult dynamic to navigate; we can’t always be particularly confident of the exact adaptations our opponents will make, or when those adaptations will occur. The way we extract ourselves from this complicated leveling war is by ensuring that we don’t overly commit to over-bluffing or under-bluffing exploitatively until we have a high level of confidence in our opponent’s tendencies. And the way we do that is by having a baseline notion of what our give-up hands are in any given spot, using the principles we’ve already discussed.
 How Accurate Are GTO Wizard's Solutions? 

If we arrive at the river with a poor bluffing candidate—which blocks some of our opponent’s folding range, doesn’t block any of their calling range, and/or has some showdown value—checking is likely to be a very good option.
But what happens when we’re simply not sure whether our hand has the right properties or not? After all, some spots are very complex.
Well, ultimately, if we want to moderate the frequencies in a way that makes sense, we can usually default to one simple protocol:
The hands with the least showdown value are more likely to want to bluff.
If we have a choice between bluffing the river with Ace-high or 9-high, and we’re not sure which of the two has the right blocking and unblocking properties, we would prefer to bluff the 9-high and check the Ace-high, simply because we can be more confident that we’re not wasting any showdown value.
Conclusion
In short, we can follow one fairly simple maxim:
If you arrive at the river and can’t easily identify any better bluffing candidates or weaker showdown value hands in your range than your current hand, your current hand will probably serve decently well as a bluff.
This will help you moderate your bluffing frequencies to some degree and make it less likely you’re going to end up with literally no bluffs at all in any specific scenario.
Hopefully, this article has given you a sense of how to make your decisions in these spots with no information about your opponent – I’ll be following this one up with an article about exploitative bluffing choices against opponents whose weaknesses we know fairly well, so look out for that one further down the line.
When Is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know
 When Is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know 

When is bluffing profitable? When you expect your opponent to fold!
That’s not a joke, and I don’t say that only because it isn’t funny. When playing against weaker players, you may be able to anticipate that they will fold, or at least that they are likely to defend at lower than the optimal frequency necessary to make your bluffs unprofitable. Bluffing is not generally very profitable, so exploiting opponents who over-fold really is where much of your profit from bluffing will come from. That is not the subject of this article, however.
What Is a Bluff?
Defining a bluff is trickier than you might think. Broadly, it could mean any bet where you are rooting for your opponent to fold, or at least rooting for them to fold hands better than yours. For our purposes, I want to be a bit more specific:
A bluff is a bet that derives most or all of its value from fold equity.
That means little to none of the bet’s value derives from pots won at showdown, whether that be winning unimproved or improving to something that can win at showdown.
      * On the river, it’s easy to meet this definition. You can’t improve your hand if your bluff doesn’t work, nor should you expect your opponent to call with a hand even weaker than your own in hopes of improving it.
      * Before the river, however, pure bluffs are rare. Most hands have some chance of improving, even if it’s just a backdoor draw or a miracle two-outer.
When I talk about bluffing before the river, I mean betting the worst hands in your range, even if they are not completely hopeless.
Bluffing in the AKQ Game
Perhaps you’ve heard of the “AKQ Game” (sometimes called the “Clairvoyance Game”). In this toy game, both players are dealt a single card from a deck containing one Ace, one King, andč one Queen. They ante and are allowed to bet as they could in a real poker game. If the hand goes to showdown, the player with the highest card wins.
Suppose you were dealt a Queen in this game. Your opponent checks, and you are last to act. Should you bet?
Reveal Answer
Real poker is more complicated. There are many cases where betting your worst hands should show a profit, and there are also many cases where you should expect it to be downright unprofitable, so it is not something you do at any frequency.
Whether or not betting your worst hands should show a profit is mostly determined by what happened on earlier streets.
A River Example
BTN opens 2.5bb in a 100bb cash game and BB calls. On a flop of A♠T♦3♦, BB checks and calls a 125% pot continuation bet. The 3♠ checks through, and the river brings the Q♥.
This is the Manhattan plot for BB’s equilibrium river strategy with their entire range, weakest hands on the left and strongest hands on the right. I’ve removed the bet sizes, so the chart simply shows how often BB bets each part of their range, without regard to size:
 When is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know 

BB river-probe strategy vs BTN on A♠T♦3♦ 3♠ Q♥ (with flop = X-B125-C)
The pure pink on the far left side of the graph means BB always bets their worst hands, stuff like 5♠2♠, which whiffed on the gutshot and backdoor flush draw. These bets must, therefore, be profitable. If BB were indifferent to bluffing, as they are in the Clairvoyance Game, we would expect to see a mix of bets and checks. Here’s the same plot in the Clairvoyance Game:
 When is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know 

BB river strategy vs BTN on 33322: Clairvoyance Game
Because BB only bets two hands in the Clairvoyance Game, this graph is easy to interpret. They always bet Aces, and they are indifferent to betting Queens.
That’s not what we see in our river example.
So the question is, why is it profitable for BB to bet their worst hands in this equilibrium? Why doesn’t BTN call more often in order to make BB indifferent to bluffing?
Choose the explanation you think is correct from the four options below, then read on for the answer.
      * BB has a reputation for being a nit, so BTN is trying to exploit them by not paying off their river-bets.
      * BTN does not have enough potential bluff-catchers to hit MDF, which would make BB indifferent to bluffing.
      * BB does not have enough potential bluffs to achieve the bluffing frequency that would incentivize BTN to bluff-catch more than they already are.
      * BB’s bluffs are carefully chosen for their blocker effects. When BB has these cards, they block BTN from having as many bluff-catchers as they otherwise would.

Where Range Advantage Comes From
BB gets profitable bluffs in this scenario because their range is much stronger than BTN’s. They have more than 70% of the equity, a dynamic illustrated dramatically by this range-vs-range equity graph:
 When is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know 

River equity distributions
So much of BTN’s range is behind so much of BB’s range that if they called more often, in the hope of picking off bluffs from those very worst hands, BB could exploit them with thinner value-bets.
But that still doesn’t get to the why. Why is BB’s range so much stronger? Why isn’t either player incentivized to do something differently on an earlier street to even out this dynamic?
BB’s Perspective
Perhaps you noticed that I pulled a fast one a few paragraphs back when I said, “It seems like calling 5♠2♠ [on the flop] is a win-win: either you improve to something strong, or you bluff and show a (small) profit.” In fact, there is a third thing that could happen—an event which quite frequently will happen, in fact—that is not so good for 5♠2♠ and which is the reason it is not a pure call on the flop: BTN might bet again on the turn, charging BB a high price to realize their equity on the river and denying them the opportunity to bluff.
The reason this dynamic can exist at equilibrium is that BB does not know, at the time they call the flop, that BTN is going to check behind the turn. If they knew that in advance, then they would call many more weak hands on the flop. But if they were to call more weak hands, then BTN could exploit them by barreling more often.
BB took a big risk with those weak calls, and they got lucky that BTN didn’t have a good barreling hand.
These profitable river bluffs are their reward for taking a risk that panned out.
BTN’s Perspective
BTN, on the other hand, took a risk that did not pay off. They bet the flop, and their opponent did not fold. Of course, not all of BTN’s range wants to see a fold, but much of it—especially much of the range that isn’t going to bet again on the turn—would very much prefer to see BB fold the flop.
BTN’s flop-bet was not nearly as risky as BB’s flop-call. They put the same amount of money into the pot, of course, but BTN had two big advantages going for them:
      * They had fold equity. When BTN bets weak hands, they might just win the pot immediately, whereas BB can’t win the pot immediately when they call. BB will sometimes get fold equity on the river after the turn checks through, and that does offset the risk of the flop-call, but they can’t count on that happening consistently.
      * Even in case their opponent did not fold, they were in position, giving them better control of the pot. They will be able to check behind the turn when they want to, facilitating free cards and cheaper showdowns.
Range advantage emerges when players take on disproportionate risk at an earlier decision point.
So, when a player fades their worst-case outcomes, they typically have an equity advantage and get to make profitable (as opposed to break-even) bluffs with their weakest hands.
The reverse is also true:
A player who takes on less risk on early streets is typically at an equity disadvantage on later streets and does not bet their worst hands at all.
For example, here is BTN’s strategy for the same scenario, facing a BB river check:
 When is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know 

BTN river strategy vs BTN check on A♠T♦3♦ 3♠ Q♥ (with flop = X-B125-C, turn = X-X)
With their very worst hand, 6♠5♠, they never bluff. Many other hands with 0% equity are also pure checks, suggesting they would be -EV bluffs. There are no pure bluffs, and the weak hands that mix bluffs are facilitated by blockers, not by an equity advantage.
A Flop Example
If we back up to the flop in our example, the roles are reversed. BTN took on more risk preflop, so they are the player who sees the flop with a stronger range (55% equity) and the player who can profitably bet their worst hands. 65 without a backdoor flush draw is the stone bottom of BTN’s range, yet even this hand has an EV of greater than 1bb (roughly 20% of the pot) and is a candidate for betting:
 When is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know 

BB has no donk-bets on this flop, and were they to face even a small c-bet, they would purely fold many of their worst hands:
 When is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know 

BB flop strategy vs BTN’s 33% pot bet on AT3tt
Because of their range disadvantage (and, to a lesser extent, their positional disadvantage), they cannot profitably bluff with the bottom of their range as BTN can. It’s not even a mix for them, as it would be in the Clairvoyance Game. Bluffing with their worst hands would lose money, on average.
But let’s get back to BTN’s strategy. In the Clairvoyance Game, a mix of bets and checks meant that bluffing was not profitable. In our river example, BB purely bet their worst hands because it was profitable. But in this flop example, BTN sometimes declines profitable bluffs.
If you’re holding 6-high, no draw, and someone told you that you could claim 20% of the pot with a bluff, that would sound awfully appealing. Why would BTN ever decline to bluff and check such a weak hand instead?
The Bluffing Voucher
The way I think about this is that when a player fades a risk and arrives at a lucky branch of the game tree, they receive a voucher that can be redeemed for one profitable bluff. That is their reward for the risk they took. Unless some new bit of bad luck comes along, they can cash in that voucher at any time. But they only get to use it once.
 When is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know 

BB had to redeem their voucher in our river example because that was their last (reliable) opportunity to do so. They can’t count on check/raising the river, because that would require their opponent’s cooperation, and they should not expect BTN to bet many of the hands they would like to fold out with a bluff.
A Turn Example
If both players check the A♠T♦3♦ flop, BB would still be at an equity disadvantage. So, it would still be unprofitable for them to bluff their worst hands (unless they had especially good blockers):
 When is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know 

BB turn-probe strategy vs BTN on A♠T♦3♦ 3♠
BTN, however, has not yet redeemed their voucher, so they once again have the option to bluff profitably with their worst hands. It is not their last opportunity, however, so they can just as profitably check and save that voucher for the river.
 When is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know 

A Different River Example
If both players check again on the turn, BB finally gets some break-even and/or profitable (with the help of blockers) bluffs on the river.
 When is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know 

BB river strategy vs BTN (with flop and turn = X-X)
The operating principle here is similar to our original river example, though the effect is less dramatic. BTN checking behind both the flop and turn was a stroke of good fortune for BB. BB would have called with more weak hands preflop if they knew they would get to see five cards for no additional investment, but of course, they did not know that. They went down a lucky branch of the game tree, and their reward was an upgrade from -EV to 0EV bluffs with the bottom of their range.
As for BTN, this is their last opportunity to redeem that voucher, so if BB checks, all their worst hands are pure bluffs:

BTN double-delayed c-bet river strategy vs BB check
Voiding the Voucher
What if BB does not check the river? If BB bets, BTN’s voucher is null and void. They mix some bluffs with their worst hands, but none of them are profitable (if they were, BTN would never fold them).
 When is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know 

BTN river strategy vs BB’s 36% pot bet
The bluffing voucher is a lucky reward for fading risk and ending up on a favorable branch of the game tree. If BB bets either the turn or river, that is an unlucky occurrence for the BTN. It is not necessarily a strong hand, but it represents more strength than a check would have, which is why BTN loses their voucher.
They could also lose their voucher in an especially unfortunate event (i.e., flop, turn, or river). That is more rare, however. By definition, a range that is favored before new card(s) are dealt will generally remain favored after the card(s) are dealt. A player’s previous-street equity, in other words, is the average of their equity on all possible runouts. So, it is only the most exceptionally bad turn cards that will disrupt their advantage.
Why Doesn’t BB Beat BTN to the Punch?
We’ve seen several examples where BTN gets profitable bluffs if BB checks but not if BB bets. If it’s that easy to void BTN’s bluffing voucher, why doesn’t BB do it more often? Why not take the initiative and bluff first, pushing BTN off the weak hands, which will eventually bluff out BB’s weak hands if given the opportunity?
They could, and sometimes they do, but it’s risky. When a player with a range advantage checks, there’s still a lot of strength in that checking range. Unless the new card is especially unlucky for BTN, it shouldn’t be profitable for BB to bet any two cards. Yes, BB could sometimes steal the pot from a weak hand that would have stolen it from them if they’d checked, but more often, they would get called or raised.
This risk is what makes BB’s bets strong, alarming, unlucky actions that disrupt BTN’s range advantage.
When a player fades risk whilst having prepared for it, they are supposed to get a reward. That’s what maintains the equilibrium.
When you are in the BTN’s shoes, it may feel bad to check the flop with a weak hand that could have profitably bluffed just to end up folding it to a turn-bet. It’s important to keep in mind that that turn-bet was far from a guarantee.
In fact, another way of looking at this outcome is that you saved money by not bluffing into a hand that wasn’t going to fold.
This is how BTN ends up indifferent between bluffing the flop versus checking the flop in hopes of bluffing later. There are risks to passing up the immediately profitable bluff: they might get an unlucky turn or induce BB to bluff with a hand that would have folded. But there are also rewards: they might get a lucky turn or find out cheaply that their bluff was never going to succeed.
 When Is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know 

Conclusion
A player acquires range advantage by taking on more risk than their opponent and then fading the worst outcomes (both unlucky board cards and unlucky opponent actions). They retain that range advantage until one of three things happens:
      * They cash it in by betting. Betting with range advantage claims a lot of EV from the branch of the game tree where your opponent folds. If they don’t fold, that is an unlucky outcome that strengthens their range (because calling and raising are risky), and you will generally be at a disadvantage going forward.
      * An especially unlucky board card(s) disrupts their advantage.
      * Their opponent takes a strong action that disrupts their advantage.
While a player has the range advantage, they essentially have a voucher that entitles them to a single profitable (+EV) bluff with even their worst hands. They can use that immediately to bluff or check and (usually) carry their range advantage forward to the next street and bluff then.
For the player without a range advantage, it is usually -EV to bet their worst hands. These players may still bet hands that prefer to get folds, but these will either have especially good blockers or be closer to semi-bluffs, hands with a decent chance of winning when called.
Only when neither player has much of an advantage, as in the Clairvoyant Game, is betting the bottom of the range 0EV for both players.
Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs
 Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs 

Blocker/unblocker was a concept my coach, Dara O’Kearney, showed me in relation to bluffs. It is one of those things that you cannot unsee once you have been shown it. It applies to pre- and postflop, and it really helps you identify good bluffs when you’re in the midst of a hand.
A good bluff should simultaneously block very strong hands and unblock the hands that we want to fold out. Blocker/unblocker is a useful heuristic for picking powerful bluffs. It is particularly pertinent preflop and on the river.
Preflop
Let’s jump right into a hand example to see what blocker/unblocker is.

A5s–A3s are clearly bluffs; they can make better hands fold like A9s–A6s and some small pocket pairs. KQo is also a bluff; similarly, it can get folds from some Ace-x and small pairs. However, these hands also make worse hands fold, but we are happy enough to take down the pot this way (especially to avoid paying rake postflop).
These might seem like quite strong hands to turn into bluffs. One of the reasons they are so effective is that:
They simultaneously block and unblock the right hands.
A5s, for example, blocks the really strong hands like AA and AK. It also unblocks a lot of weaker (but still threatening) hands that fold like K9s–K5s, QTs–Q8s, and so on. So, just to be crystal clear, the Ace is a blocker, and the 5 is an unblocker.
Tournament Hand Example
Let’s look at a spot where preflop action is more significant, and taking the pot down then and there is very valuable, i.e., in tournaments. These are 20bb symmetrical stacks near the bubble. This is the CO opening range:

CO response vs BTN all-in (20bb) raise
Looking at the folds, we can tell the primary bluffs are, once again, low suited Ace-x. They block the stronger Ace-x continues, while also unblocking all the suited Broadway hands that fold. There are some suited Broadway bluff-shoves like KQs–KTs. They block many of the calling hands, such as KK, QQ, AK, AQ, JJ, and TT, but also unblock folding hands like the small pocket pairs, as well as Ace-x. We also see a small amount of bluff-raising with hands like K3s, which block KK/AK calls and unblock a lot of the suited Q-x and J-x hands that fold.
Notice that we do not see bluffs with hands like J3s. And it so happens to be that they mostly go against the blocker/unblocker heuristic:
      * By not blocking enough (only JJ in this spot) of the strong calling hands
      * And not unblocking enough of the sort of hands that we’d like to get folds from
There is another reason why we mostly pick suited hands like A5s and K3s for our bluffs. They block strong hands, they unblock folds, and crucially, they can make very strong hands when called. A hand like A5s or K3s is in bad shape when it is called by AA, KK, or AK, but it still has a little bit of extra chance of outdrawing via a flush by the river. The low cards in the bluffs are also at least ‘live’ in the sense that they have some outdraw possibilities by making a low straight or trips, which the AA and KK-type hands cannot.
This is why A5–A2s make particularly strong bluffs. They block continues, they unblock ‘discontinues,’ they make (nut) flushes, and they make (wheel) straights.
Postflop
Let’s look at this concept in a postflop scenario. This hand is on the river of an NL500 cash game. UTG has opened, and the BB has called.
      * The flop is A♠9♠6♥.
      * The flop has gone check, bet 33% pot, call.
      * The turn is a 5♥.
      * It goes check, bet 75% pot, call.
      * The river is a 2♦.
These are the ranges for both players on the river with their equities:
 Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs 

River ranges on A♠9♠6♥ 5♥ 2♦ (view: equity)
UTG has all the nutted (90%+ equity) hands, but the BB has a lot of strong (70–90% EQ) hands they will want to get value with by betting them, which means they will also need some bluffs.
With that in mind, this is the BB’s first action on the river:
 Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs 

 Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs 

BB first-in river strategy
Mostly checks, but ~5% of the time, the BB leads. They have straights, two pairs, and top pairs that all want to extract value and do not want UTG to check back.
That means they also need some bluffs. Given that ~48% of hands in the range are under 50% equity and 14% of the range is considered ‘trash,’ the BB has plenty of options for the bluffs.
Looking at the flop, my initial instinct regarding bluffs would be to prefer 8-x and 7-x because they block straights. I’d be avoiding bluffing spade or heart draws that missed, because I know that missed flush draws often make bad bluffs because they block other missed flush draws that would make up a big part of the folding range. I’d probably pick K8s, even though the only available combo is spades, because it blocks straights, AK, KK, and K9.
However, the actual commonly used bluff hands here are all suited misses! 8♠4♠ and 7♠3♠ are pure bluffs. 7♠4♠, J♠8♠, T♥8♥ and T♥7♥ are frequent bluffs.
The fact that they have the suits from the missed flush draws is probably because there were two flush draws by the turn, and any hand with diamonds or clubs will have gotten out of the way already. So, the heuristic of missed flush draws being bad bluffs is not disproven, but here, we don’t have many alternatives to choose from.
Every hand has an 8 or 7, which obviously blocks the straight. Let’s look at the response to the 35% pot river donk-bet to learn more about the unblocker properties of our bluffs:
 Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs 

 Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs 

UTG response vs BB’s 35% pot river donk-bet
UTG folds ~30% of the time. The hands that fold are predominantly Broadway hands that had a flush draw as well! Hands like K♠Q♠, K♠J♠, K♥J♥, K♠T♠, K♥T♥, K♠8♠, K♠7♠, Q♠J♠, Q♠T♠, Q♥T♥, JTs and some offsuit hands like KQo, KJo, KTo, QTo etc. There are other hands that fold, but most of the folds are unpaired hands with a King or Queen in them.
All of our primary bluffs unblock those hands. A hand like 8♠4♠ blocks the nut straight and also unblocks all of those Broadway folds. This is not a high-adrenaline bluff that would make a TV highlight reel by getting a monster to fold; it’s merely targeting all the trash in the range. Hands that would all check back if it was checked to them.
Looking back on what my instincts were, K8s would be a terrible bluff because it blocks half of the hands that would have folded.
We are going to look at two different postflop features of GTO Wizard that may show us the blocker/unblocker value of hands. The first one is the value and trash removal scores in the “Summary” tab. When we bluff, we want to remove value, but not trash.
These are the scores for some of our bluffs:
 Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs 

Removal scores of BB’s (river donk) bluffs
Let’s compare that to K8s, which I thought would make for a good bluff before studying this spot:
 Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs 

It’s true that K8s removes more value, but it also removes much more trash, which we do not want because trash (better than our own trash) is all we can get to fold. So, in this hand example, our bluffs are primarily being selected based on their unblocking properties.
Going back to the UTG response to the lead, they raise the BB’s lead 30% of the time, mostly by going all-in. The value is mostly sets and two pairs, but what about the bluffs?
The most common bluff is 9-x: K9s, Q9s, J9s, and 89s all turn their second pair into a bluff. The other common bluffs are the small pocket pairs (44 and 33). Finally, K5s when it is not spades bluffs.
Let’s look at the BB’s response to the UTG river raise shove to see why these hands are picked to jam:
 Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs 

 Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs 

BB response vs UTG’s 266% pot river raise all-in
Most of the two pairs that call feature a 9, and a set of nines is in the opponent’s range, so the 9 blocks a lot of value. 89s is the master blocker in this respect, as not only does it block two pairs and sets, it also blocks the straight.
The BB did not bluff at the start of the river action with a K/Q/J because these cards were in the hands that UTG would’ve folded, so the BB picked hands like 84s, which unblocked those folds. This is precisely why these same high cards are in the UTG bluffing range; they were never in BB’s bluffing hands. So, these cards unblock BB’s bluffs.
What is a bad unblocker for one player is (often) a good unblocker for their opponent.
The other hand class that bluffs is the small pairs (44 and 33). They have the obvious blocker value of blocking the wheel straight. They also unblock the J8s–J7s, T8s–T7s hands that all bluffed. K5s also belongs to this category. Low pairs turned into bluffs are pretty similar. The difference is that they block another sort of value; instead of straights, they block some two pair combos that call. The similarity is that they also unblock the same bluffs as 44 and 33 do.
Another useful tool in GTO Wizard is the “Blockers” tab, which shows you whether a particular card in one player’s range increases or decreases the other player’s frequencies of folding/calling/raising. For example, this is the node when BB is facing an all-in. If UTG has the cards below, the feature shows the likelihood the BB will call or fold:
 Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs 

Cards sorted in UTG’s range based on the increase of BB’s folds
The 3♠ is the most powerful blocker, which is found sometimes in UTG’s bluffing range with 33, as it simultaneously blocks straights and unblocks the hands that fold. (The only fold with a 3 in it is 73s, which is a tiny part of the opponent’s range). It increases the chances of folding by 2.78%. As you can see, 6-x and 9-x also increase the folding frequency significantly, and UTG’s bluff range had a lot of 9-x in it.
Similarly, this tab can also reveal the cards with the worst blocker value for your objective:
 Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs 

Cards sorted in UTG’s range based on the decrease of BB’s folds
2♠ is the worst card to bluff with, as it unblocks all the strong two pair combos that call, as well as blocking the only two pair combos that fold. Having this card in your hand increases the chances of being called by 5.93% at equilibrium.
Throughout this article, my instinct was that K♠8♠ would be a good bluff both as a lead and as a reraise. However, just like the value/trash removal feature showed me earlier, it looks like a terrible bluff. This time we can see that both those cards increase our chances of being called by a combined 0.5%.
Conclusion
I picked preflop and river examples to cover this heuristic because, in my experience, that is when the blocker/unblocker effect is most pronounced. On the flop and turn, improvability is perhaps a more significant factor when picking bluffs.
      * Before the flop, there is no board yet to determine which hands have improvability.
      * On the river, there are no more cards to come, so no more ways to improve.
We saw that blocker/unblocker is a heuristic for picking bluffs. With two cards in your hand, it is possible to find bluffs where one of your cards blocks value and the other one unblocks folds. But this heuristic can guide us in the process of value-betting as well. A good hand to value-bet will unblock worse hands that you want to get called by while also blocking better hands that you do not want to get called by.
The Art of Turn-Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops
 The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops 

After calling a 3-bet as the out of position (OOP) player, you should expect to see a flop continuation bet from your in position (IP) opponent. In a 100bb CO vs BTN scenario, for example, BTN c-bets more than 80% of the time at equilibrium.
The 3-bettor, having taken on more risk preflop, arrives at the flop with a stronger range. On most flops, they will possess both an equity advantage and a nuts advantage, the combination of which facilitates aggressive continuation betting.
As the caller, you’ll often end up check/folding or check/calling with the expectation that future streets will be tough to play. That’s not a failure of knowledge or strategy on your part; it’s merely the consequence of your bad luck for opening into a hand strong enough to 3-bet you.
But what happens when the IP raiser does not c-bet the flop?
      * Is the pot now yours for the taking?
      * Which turn cards will be better or worse for you to bet at?
      * How much should you bet?
      * With which hands?
This article will examine all that and more.
Aggregate Turn Strategy
For our examples, we will look at the CO vs BTN configuration, as it is the one that occurs most commonly. The general principles discussed here will apply to other configurations where the 3-bettor is in position as well, though, of course, the details will differ.
We can’t look at CO’s aggregate turn-probe strategy across all possible flops, so we’ll instead look at their aggregate strategy on a variety of textures, all of which feature among BTN’s most checked flops. This is less of a compromise than it may seem because there are many flops on which BTN bets all or almost all of their range. Checking really is a notable exception for them; a significant part of their strategy only on specific board textures such as the ones that follow.
 The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops 

 The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops 

The major determinant of CO’s turn-probe frequency is how much equity they flop.
Here, we see a pretty sharp divide between boards where CO frequently probes the turn and boards where they are more judicious. The major determinant of CO’s turn-probe frequency is how much equity they flop: on boards where they flop half or more of the equity, they probe much more frequently than on those where they flop significantly less.
Higher frequency turn-bets also correlate with smaller bet sizes. This makes sense: a narrower range is generally a more polar range, which benefits from larger bet sizes.
These different probe sizes have fundamentally different purposes (dare I say targets?). Smaller bets pressure weak hands in BTN’s range, hands which could easily be drawing slim or dead, and so will struggle to continue profitably even when getting very good odds. Larger bets pressure medium hands, the sort that would happily call a smaller bet, but begin to worry about drawing dead when facing an overbet.
On more favorable (for IP) board textures, BTN usually c-bets their weakest hands, so a small probe from CO would not accomplish much. To the extent that they check, they are weighted toward medium hands, not weak ones.

Manhattan plot

Advanced equity buckets
Thus, when BTN does not c-bet these flops, CO still mainly checks the turn, often with the intention of giving up. When CO does probe, they either have a very strong hand or represent one with a bluff. This polar strategy pressures the mostly medium hands in BTN’s checking range.
On less favorable boards, BTN’s checks come disproportionately from their weakest hands. This is partly because they have flopped more weak hands on these boards and partly because they have more incentive to protect their medium hands with a bet. Unless the turn card is one of the few that dramatically improves the weak hands in BTN’s checking range, CO can probe with small bets to pressure those weak hands.
BTN’s Flop Strategy on 6♥5♥4♦
 The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops 

 The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops 

To be clear, there are still plenty of medium hands in BTN’s checking range on these less favorable flops, which is why CO’s equilibrium strategy still includes some polar betting. The biggest difference between BTN’s strategy on better and worse flops is the prevalence of weak hands in their checking range. That, in turn, accounts for the difference in CO’s use of small probe-bets.
Probing BTN’s Bad Flops
CO’s aggregate turn-probe strategy on 6♥5♥4♦ is a powerful demonstration of how starkly different the strategy is on BTN’s best turn cards:
 The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops 

CO’s aggregate turn-probe strategy on 654tt
When a card from the lower half of the deck turns, CO leads most or all of their range, usually for a small size. On an 8♣ turn, for example, CO bets almost everything. The main exceptions are AJ and AQ, which both block and dominate BTN’s folds:
 The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops 

Manhattan plot: CO probe-bet turn strategy vs BTN on 654tt 8r
On low card boards, BTN’s checking range is full of unpaired hands that will struggle to continue even when getting a good price.
Notice also that CO’s large bets come almost exclusively from their strongest hands (straights and sets) and weakest hands. These weakest hands tend to be unpaired hands that can make dominating hands fold while retaining a few outs when called. This includes gutshots like T9s and K9s and flush draws like Q♥J♥.
High Turns
Aces and Kings are much better turns for BTN than even Queens or Jacks. On an Ace and King turn, CO rarely bets and strictly uses a larger, polarized sizing when they do bet. For example, when the A♣ turns, CO bets 125% pot with about 13% of their range, including sets and two pairs for value and flush and straight draws as bluffs. These bluffs still have 25–50% equity; CO is not fighting for the pot with their very worst hands:
 The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops 

Manhattan plot: CO probe-bet turn strategy vs BTN on 654tt Ar
Probing BTN’s Better Flops
When BTN checks a favorable flop like A♥8♥7♦, it should (usually) not be because their hand is weak. Mostly, it should be because they have something medium like KK or QQ or A3. This has a few implications for CO’s probing strategy:
      * BTN’s checking range is full of bluff-catchers. With the added disadvantage of being out of position, CO can not expect to show a profit betting their worst hands on most turns. If CO were to bluff too much here, BTN could exploit them not only by bluff-catching but also by checking more traps on the flop.
      * When CO does bet, it should be for a size that puts those modest pairs to the test.
      * CO should probe less often on turn cards that improve the medium hands in BTN’s checking range.
The worst turns for CO to bet are Aces, Kings, Queens, Eights, and Sevens:
 The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops 

CO’s aggregate turn-probe strategy on A87tt
You might be accustomed to thinking it’s good for OOP when the turn pairs the second or third card, but that’s only if the preflop aggressor c-bet the flop. Because that c-betting range should be somewhat polar, cards that improve medium hands are bad for a c-bettor.
By that same logic, turn cards that improve medium hands are good for the preflop aggressor if they did not c-bet the flop. Their range is thick with hands like Q9, K8, and KK, which like seeing a board pair or a Broadway card roll off.
Flush and straight draws, on the other hand, are appealing c-betting candidates. That means BTN is less likely to have them after checking, so flushing and straightening turns are better cards for CO to probe. Very low cards also do not interact with BTN’s checking range, and so are good cards for CO to probe as well.
CO’s probe strategy on A♥8♥7♦ 3♦ looks much like their probe strategy for playing an Ace turn on a flop that’s less favorable to BTN. That is, CO bets big and polar, drawing their bluffs not from air but from draws. This particular board offers both heart and diamond draws, so the lowest-equity bluffs are poor straight draws like 6♠5♠, not complete air:
 The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops 

Manhattan plot: CO probe-bet turn strategy vs BTN on A♥8♥7♦ 3♦
If the 3 on the turn is a third ♥, CO’s betting pattern looks quite similar, but the size of their bet shifts downward, preferring 75% pot to overbets. In fact, they use this smaller sizing on all heart turns:
 The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops 

Manhattan plot: CO probe-bet turn strategy vs BTN on A♥8♥7♦ 3♥
Despite the incentive to bet flush draws on the flop, BTN does retain some in their checking range. Some of their medium hands also pick up flush draws, making them more comfortable calls even against overbets. However, the pairs that did not turn flush draws will have tough decisions even against the 75% pot bet, given how easily they could be drawing dead.
CO’s betting pattern is similar on a worse turn like the Q♦, but with less betting overall:
 The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops 

Manhattan plot: CO probe-bet turn strategy vs BTN on A♥8♥7♦ Q♦
It’s also worth noting that CO mixes 125% and 175% pot on the 3♦ turn but uses 125% exclusively on the Q♦. They simply don’t want to put as much money into the pot when the turn card is so likely to help their already somewhat strong opponent.
Conclusion
The 3-bettor will have a stronger preflop range than the caller. That translates into an equity advantage on most flops, which, combined with a positional advantage, discourages their opponent from contesting the pot with weak hands. Even when the 3-bettor checks the flop, it will often be correct for you to check and give up on the turn if you’ve got nothing going on.
Just how much you need to have going on depends on the board texture…
Keep an eye out for favorable turn cards that could provide turn-probing opportunities, while selecting for the discussed hand categories/types.
The Many Faces of Balance in Poker
 The Many Faces of Balance in Poker 

When you think of balance in poker, what comes to mind?
Most likely, you were introduced to the concept by the relationship between bluffing and bluff-catching. If your betting range is imbalanced—if you bluff too much or not enough, relative to the number of value hands you could have in a given spot—then your opponent can exploit you by bluff-catching more or less. Conversely, if they bluff-catch too much or not enough, you can exploit them by bluffing less or more.
 The Many Faces of Balance in Poker 

This is a great introductory example of how balance functions because it is simple, clean, and straightforwardly calculated (on the river, anyway). It’s easy to see the relationship between your strategy and your opponent’s, and how an imbalance on one side of the scale incentivizes the other player to be imbalanced as well in order to exploit the deviation.
This is just one simple example of balance, however. Many other such relationships exist, operating behind the scenes. And, as they all play a part in shaping the equilibrium strategies returned by solvers, they can also be used to explain why the outputs look the way they do, with so many different hands mixing at specific frequencies.
Most of them, however, are not as easily calculated as bluffing and bluff-catching frequencies, so the goal of this article is not to solve them precisely (you wouldn’t be able to do so during in-game situations anyway) but simply to understand the relationships so that you can think more deeply about vulnerabilities in your strategies and those of your opponents.
Early Streets
Before the river, most hands can not be neatly classified as “bluff” or “value.” Colloquially, we may categorize a hand as a bluff, but for a deeper understanding of its true nature, it’s important to recognize the following fact:
A hand’s ability to still win the pot if called, whether by improving or bluffing again, is an important difference from river bluffs.
The general relationship between bluffing and bluff-catching still exists on earlier streets, but the ratios do not usually work out so cleanly because hands are not as clearly defined. There is also a new balance to consider when betting or facing a bet:
 The Many Faces of Balance in Poker 

Because hands can change value, there is some incentive for a player facing a bet to raise with bluff-catchers rather than calling, as they would on the river.
The reward of raising bluff-catchers is that it enables them to deny equity or get additional value from draws and perhaps even to push the opponent off a better hand that was itself betting for thin value and protection.
The risk of raising bluff-catchers is that it could mean putting in money when way behind against the top of the bettor’s range and missing profitable bluff-catches against the bottom on future streets.
GTO betting ranges usually consist of:
      * A more polar component of hands, which do not mind getting raised (strong hands are happy to continue, very weak hands lose little beyond the initial bet when they fold), and
      * A more linear component of hands, which benefit from folds, do not mind getting called but hate getting raised.
These linear hands include both semi-bluffs and thin value-bets from non-nut hands, many of which will not be strong enough to bet again on future streets but can benefit from denying equity while still having a reasonable chance of winning when called.
An overly polar betting range offers the opponent little incentive to raise. An overly linear betting range offers little incentive to call.
The balance between the polar and linear components corresponds with the balance between the opponent’s calling and raising frequencies.
Board Coverage
“Board coverage” is a nebulous concept that, although related to balance, is harder to quantify. Essentially, the way to achieve board coverage and the motivation behind it comes down to the following:
In any non-folding range (betting, checking, calling, raising), players are incentivized to include a variety of hand types so that they will not be overly predictable on future streets.
For example, if there are two hearts on the board (♥♥X), it will generally be correct to have flush draws in both your betting and checking ranges so that your opponent cannot confidently value-bet non-flush hands on the next street that brings a third ♥ no matter what your action is on the current street.
It will also generally be correct to have other weak hands besides flush draws in both ranges, so that you have something to bluff with when the flush comes in. I first learned this concept from Alex Sutherland, who has an excellent demonstration on his now-defunct GTO Range Builder blog.
 The Many Faces of Balance in Poker 

The amount of money your opponent will put into the pot on future branches of the game tree determines your incentive to arrive at those branches with certain hands. This is related to the concept of “implied odds”—the incentive to call with a drawing hand despite not getting the right immediate odds because of additional bets you could win if the draw comes in—though it is more complex than that. Taking weak hands to future streets can be correct not only because they may over-realize equity by value-betting when they improve but also because they may over-realize equity by bluffing when they don’t improve.
This can only be taken so far, however. Not even solvers can profitably design strategies that will be perfectly balanced on all possible runouts! Typically, they invest in balance for big classes of hands like flush and straight draws but do not find it worth the cost to invest in otherwise worthless hands just to balance around edge cases such as the one or two cards that complete both draws. In those rare cases, they simply accept that they are imbalanced and make the best of it.
Acting First on the River
The above concept applies not only on early streets but also when you are acting first on the river (or really, any time you are not closing the action). It is about future decision points, not necessarily future streets. But on the river, it is most often a consideration for the player acting first.
 The Many Faces of Balance in Poker 

Because the out of position (OOP) player’s checks do not close the action, they have some incentive to check their strongest hands, to induce bets (such as bluffs and value-bets from worse) and then get in a raise. They also have some incentive to bet their strongest hands, to induce bluff- and value-raises from worse (in addition to getting calls from worse hands that would have checked).
The same can be said for the in position (IP) player, if they are using multiple sizes. They have some obvious incentive to bet big (often all-in) with their nut hands, but they also have incentive to bet smaller as a trap, hoping to induce raises from hands that would not have called a shove.
Much as on earlier streets, the ratio of traps to thin value is what determines the opponent’s incentive to raise as a bluff or for value with their own non-nut hands.
      * Traps are hands that want to get raised.
      * Thin value are hands that are ahead when called but lose EV when raised (because they will sometimes lose to bluffs when they fold and lose to strong hands when they call).
Facing a Raise Before the Flop
All the above considerations apply to preflop play as well, which is, of course, an early street. In fact, the difficulty of classifying hands as “bluff” or “value” is especially salient before the flop, where it’s tough for any hand to have more than 70% or less than 30% equity. The extra wrinkle before the flop is that, unless the action folds to the SB, you are potentially playing a multiway pot, and the whole idea of equilibrium gets tricky in multiway pots.
 Principles of GTO 

Suppose HJ opens, and you 3-bet from the CO. You’ve got a well-constructed range balanced around the concepts we’ve discussed above with a linear component incentivizing HJ to 4-bet and a polar component incentivizing HJ to call and a smattering of suited connectors so you’ve got something to bluff with on Broadway boards and something to stack off with on medium, connected boards. Then along comes the BTN and kicks over your precisely balanced scale with a cold 4-bet.
Your 3-bet range is still mostly balanced against the original raiser, determined mostly by how often they will call and 4-bet and how they will play after the flop, because they are by far the player most likely to contest the pot with you. But you are also constrained by the other players holding cards, which is why CO VPIPs more hands into an LJ open than HJ does and BTN VPIPs more still. They’re all facing the same original raise, but with more players remaining to act behind them, the earlier position players need stronger hands to contest the pot.
Response to LJ Raise, 100bb Cash
 The Many Faces of Balance in Poker 

What’s all this got to do with balance and exploitability?
Suppose you’re in the CO facing a raise, and you know the BTN is an extremely tight and passive player who will fold far more hands than a solver would and rarely raise. Or, if you’re playing live poker, maybe you look left and see them preparing to fold their cards. In either case, you basically have the BTN and can play a strategy that involves a lot more calling than you would typically do in this spot (which is still not terribly much, to be clear!).
Conversely, if the BTN is overactive, you should be a bit tighter in the CO and favor a raise-or-fold strategy.
Playing Kingmaker
In heads-up pots, mixed strategies are all about balance.
When a solver mixes a certain hand between, say, bets and checks, that’s because there’s incentive to have that hand in both ranges.
If you show up with any type of hand too often in one range, your opponent could exploit you in some way.
This is not necessarily the case in a multiway pot, however. Notice how, in BTN’s response to a LJ raise, virtually every VPIPing hand mixes call and raise:
 The Many Faces of Balance in Poker 

BTN response vs LJ min-raise: EV display (NL500, 100bb)
You could fiddle around with these mixes of calls vs raises—doing a lot more calling or a lot more raising—and it would not affect your EV or exploitability nearly as much as it would in a heads-up pot. What you’re essentially doing by turning these dials is determining how the remaining EV is split between the players left to act (e.g., LJ and BB, and, to a lesser extent, SB).
 The Many Faces of Balance in Poker 

It’s generally better for LJ when you raise, as this makes it much less likely the blinds will contest the pot and so more likely LJ will win it if you do not. Raising does not so much accrue EV for yourself as it does redistribute EV from BB → LJ.
Conversely, calling makes it more likely the blinds will enter the pot, allowing them to realize their equity at LJ’s expense. Sure, sometimes the blinds win a pot you would have won had you 3-bet, but calling has the advantage of risking less than raising would.
So for you, it often ends up being an even tradeoff, with most hands showing no clear preference for calling or raising. LJ loves it when you 3-bet because they benefit from the fold equity you are paying for, whereas BB loves it when you call because they get cheap overcalling opportunities you allowed for.
That’s what the equilibria look like, anyway. In a real-game situation, LJ might be a tough opponent and BB a soft one. In that case, you have a lot of incentive to call, as you don’t want to do your tough opponent any favors and you’d welcome weakness in the pot. Whereas if LJ is the soft player, you’d like to isolate weakness by 3-betting more aggressively to shut out tough opponents in the blinds.
Conclusion
Solver strategies are a product of a series of precisely balanced compromises between competing incentives. Every little detail matters, even if it is not obvious how. There is some reason why the solver calls K6s but not K7s. And there is some reason why it does so 20% of the time rather than 18%.
Some of these reasons are based on the opponent’s incentives on the current street, while others will pay off on specific runouts on future streets. Often, it’s both. Solvers are extremely efficient in this way.
However, you will never get all these balances exactly right in a real-game situation, and neither will your opponents. But by understanding all the tradeoffs, you can make better decisions about how to remain roughly balanced yourself. Plus, you will also be better equipped to predict imbalances in your opponents’ play and introduce intentional imbalances in your own game to exploit theirs.

Playing the river may seem scary. Pots, on average, have been swelling up big time at this point, and even small mistakes can mean a substantial loss of big blinds. But do not panic because after digesting this article, you will be ready to outplay your opponents and maneuver as the preflop aggressor (PFA) from out of position (OOP) through all kinds of challenging river spots in 3-bet pots. Let’s get our feet (and hands) wet by immersing ourselves in the world of rivers!
Impact of Earlier Streets
As discussed in the previous article “Mastering Turn Play in 3-Bet Pots OOP,” earlier streets have significant consequences for our game on later streets. How we construct our turn range will always affect how we play the river.
Let’s examine the following scenario more closely to understand how turn play impacts our river game plan.
 Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP 

The SB 3-bettor’s turn barrel strategy vs BTN on K93tt 2r (after flop went B20-C)
After frequently betting for a small sizing on the flop, the SB arrives with an extensive range on the turn, and so does the BTN. Due to the excellent pot odds, IP has to defend very wide versus a 20% flop c-bet.
Hands like second pair (9-x) and underpairs (TT–QQ) are, therefore, still strong enough to bet again for a small sizing. They get called by worse pairs and benefit from protection by denying a decent amount of EQ. On the other hand, the SB still has a notable number of hands that want to build even larger pots, such as strong King-x, two pairs, and sets. These hand classes would prefer a bigger turn sizing.
We can now use different turn strategies. Let us determine how splitting the betting between a small (20% pot) and big (75% pot) turn sizing will impact how we play the river on a board-pairing nine.

The SB 3-bettor’s triple barrel river strategy vs BTN on K93tt 2r 9r (after flop B20-C, turn B20-C)
River After Small Turn Barrel
First, let us explore the river after betting small on the turn. When we take a look at the “Ranges” tab and the “Equity chart,” a couple of things stand out immediately:
      * The SB shows up with a considerable advantage on the river! Betting 20% on the turn allows OOP to include a good chunk of 9-x, which means OOP rivers some amount of trips, even relatively close to the amount of the IP player.
      * OOP arrives with more full houses on the river. IP raises their sets and K9 very aggressively on earlier streets versus the small sizes, while we put hands like KK into our small-betting range since they block much of the hands that call bigger bets.
      * OOP has a significant advantage in TT–QQ (underpairs), while IP has way more third pairs. The SB is small-betting the turn a lot with those TT–QQ, while the BTN is forced to continue with a notable amount (over 80% of the time) of third pairs versus a 20% bet. This means those underpairs are still worth a small bet on the river in SB’s shoes because IP has so many weaker pairs.
      * TLDR: The SB’s range, in general, dominates IP’s range. Due to the nature of both ranges—with the BTN being forced to continue with an extensive range on the turn (almost 85% of the time) and the SB already having an advantage on flop and turn—the SB gets to bet river very frequently with a merged range for various sizes.
River After Large Turn Barrel
To further drive home the point of the impact of turn play, let us now take a glance at our river strategy after using a bigger (75% pot) turn bet:
 Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP 

The SB 3-bettor’s triple barrel river strategy vs BTN on K93tt 2r 9r (after flop B20-C, turn B75-C)
We will, once again, consult the same tools—the ”Ranges” tab and “Equity chart”— to understand what’s happening. What differences do we notice?
      * What stands out the most is that the SB now finds themselves at a disadvantage in most of the different range parts. OOP doesn’t double barrel any 9-x for a large sizing, while IP still defends all 9-x. The BTN also gets to continue significantly less versus the 75% pot bet sizing, which heavily filters IP’s range and makes it much tighter. IP arrives on the river with almost 3 times fewer underpairs, way fewer bricked draws, and practically no single Ace-high. IP’s range is much stronger and more concentrated around top pairs and trips.
      * OOP, conversely, arrives with much more air and even significantly fewer nutted hands on the river. The result is that the SB now has to check a lot and can not use large sizes due to the nut disadvantage that they find themselves in.
The drastic differences in OOP’s river strategy showcased how important it is to understand how our ranges look on previous streets.
Building an unbreakable river strategy to bridge across requires understanding the foundations laid in the earlier streets because you will be building on top of them.

Why Using Multiple Sizes on the River Is Essential
We generally split our range into multiple sizes because there are various hand classes that explicitly want to bet different amounts to achieve different things. As we examined in the previous articles about playing 3-bet pots OOP, using multiple sizes on earlier streets is not mandatory.
The EV difference between having a more complex strategy with multiple sizes and a simple one with just one size is often very close. The issue is that the difficulty of executing a multi-size strategy will increase drastically compared to the simplified single-size strategy. Splitting our range as early as the flop and/or turn implies a larger game tree with many more nodes and branches that have to be considered and studied. In theory, all these different lines have to be balanced with the right amount of strong hands and bluffs. The following graphic displays the exponential nature of game complexity when using various flop and turn sizes:
      * On the left, a simpler game tree with one bet size on flop and turn, to only split on the river into two bet sizes.
      * On the right, a more complex game tree that already splits from the flop onward into two bet sizes.
(Keep in mind that there’s always the check option as well.)
 Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP 

The complexity of game trees: simpler (12 river nodes) vs more complex (27 river nodes)
We are not robots. Going with a relatively simple strategy that you’re able to play on a high level will consistently outperform a more complex one where we make way more mistakes and theoretically only gain a minimal amount of EV.
However, there are situations where we certainly want to mix multiple sizes on earlier streets for exploitative reasons, such as spots where our opponents are too passive and do not raise enough versus the small sizing. All our nutted hands would now heavily miss out on value when not enough money goes into the pot. This means we need to take matters into our own hands and use a big sizing for our strongest hands and a smaller one for our marginal hand classes. We don’t need to concern ourselves with balancing both of our lines as we are purely focusing on what each hand in our range wants. This will always be our highest EV choice versus weak opponents who are unable to counter effectively.
We aren’t there yet, though; there is one last street to traverse. Once we’re on the river, splitting our range into multiple sizings becomes indispensable; if you bet small on the flop with a hand that wants to build a large pot, you can still use huge sizes on the river to put in as much money as you wish. After the river, though, the hand ends. We need to find a size now that fits our hand’s value. When we arrive on the river with distinct hand classes who explicitly want to put in different amounts of money, we must build our strategy around two sizings. Since the hand ends on the river, there is also no future street complexity to worry about.
If you feel like digging deeper into the topic of whether multiple sizes actually matter, jump in here 🕳️🐇
Now we have learned why splitting the river is mandatory, we are mentally prepared to dive into that strategic complexity. 3, 2, 1, …
Diving Into the River
Although it might sound counterintuitive, the river is the easiest street to play on. There are no future streets to worry about, and ranges are often more defined and filtered.
However, playing the river is still no child’s play. Due to all the different rivers, finding a way to get a grip on a strong river strategy can feel elusive. We need to simplify our approach to rivers so we can smoothly navigate through all of them.
Grouping rivers will help us to find patterns and design heuristics effectively.
To get a better understanding of river play, we are going to explore two different groups:
      * Brick river
      * Nut-changing river
Dry, Brick Rivers
To portray how to play on cards that don’t shuffle up the equity distribution of the ranges after the turn action has concluded, we will examine A♠9♣2♥ 7♠ 4♦.
 Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP 

The SB 3-bettor’s triple barrel river strategy vs BTN on A92tt 7r 4r (after flop B20-C, turn B75-C): 100bb starting
When reviewing the river strategy, one thing should immediately catch your eye!
      * The SB mainly has one large (all-in) sizing. The only hand that wants to use a smaller sizing is AJ. AJ only makes up roughly 3.6% of our entire range. When certain hands wanting to use a specific size are very scarce, we don’t need to bother building a strategy around that.
The question is, why do we just use one large sizing here?
Let us find out together with the help of the EQ buckets and chart!
 Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP 

The EQ buckets and chart on A92tt 7r 4r (left = SB, right = BTN)
What do you notice here? There are two interesting things to find that explain why the SB only wants to go all-in (87% pot):
      * The EQ buckets and chart from the SB clearly indicate a highly polarized range. The SB has considerably more nutted and strong hands with 80–100% EQ but also way more very low equity hands (air) below 25% EQ.
      * The BTN’s range, however, is dense in bluff-catchers with between 25–70% EQ. All hands with more than 80% EQ (i.e., AQ and better) are strong enough to go all-in, given that the SPR < 1.
This undoubtedly shows us that due to SB’s polar nature and the relatively low SPR, they have little—remember AJ—to no interest in using a smaller size. This is usually the case on brick river runouts after having polarized previous streets being 100bb deep. We can often simplify to checking or going all-in.
It is important to note that SPR plays an important role here, though!
Deeper Rivers
 Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP 

The SB 3-bettor’s river strategy vs BTN on on A92tt 7r 4r (after flop B20-C, turn B125-C): 200bb starting
When we explore the same spot, but being 200bb deep, we can see that the SB now clearly wants to use non-all-in sizes too. Hands like AK/AQ that were previously strong enough to go all-in, don’t get called enough by worse when they jam with an SPR of ~1.28 (instead of ~0.86). In this case, it’s worth building a smaller size around a hand like AK since this hand alone makes up almost 20% of OOP’s river range in this spot!
Wet, Nut-Changing Rivers
To contrast, we can compare the same spot up to the point where the river card now changes the nuts: a flush-completing 4♥.
 Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP 

The SB 3-bettor’s river strategy vs BTN on A92tt 7r 4t flush-completer (after flop B20-C, turn B75-C): 100bb starting
Comparing the river strategy on the flush-completing 4 demonstrates one thing:
      * OOP now clearly wants to use one small and one large size. All of SB’s strong turn hands, such as two pairs or the best top pairs, got devalued on this nut-changing river. They are now only strong enough to bet for a small size. Blocking the river often outperforms checking in nut-changing spots, because we prevent the opponent from checking back all worse hands or re-opening the action for a larger size.
Let’s switch tabs—from “Strategy” to “Ranges”—to examine the reasons for this strategic shift a bit more closely.
 Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP 

The EQ buckets and chart on A92tt 7r 4t flush-completer (left = SB, right = BTN)
The EQ buckets and chart are now slightly different. The BTN gains a significant amount of nutted hands, which severely reduces the SB’s nut advantage. Due to the nut change, all of SB’s turn nuts, and very strong hands such as AK or two pairs are now downgraded in the hierarchy of EQ buckets. For that reason, OOP now dominates the buckets between 25 and 80%; it also perfectly illustrates why OOP wants to have a small-betting range: OOP has a lot of medium-strength hands now that still can go for thin value but are too weak to jam.
The slightly more tricky part is now to figure out which size each hand prefers.
      * Value – We need to define a value threshold to determine which hand classes go for what size. Looking at the river strategy, we want to jam with all our sets and better. Our two pairs, AK and AQ, go into our small sizing. A cool heuristic here is that the weakest hand that could have gone all-in on a brick river also fits the threshold for blocking on a nut-changing river. We put some of our flushes into our small size to prevent our small-betting range from becoming too weak. Usually, flushes that heavily block the calling range, like K♥Q♥.
      * Bluffs – Finding the right bluffs for each sizing can be more challenging. But don’t worry, we got you! Generally, on the river, it comes down to blocking effects:
•  Using bluffs with good blocking effects for our big sizes.
•  And bluffs with poor blocking qualities use the small sizes or just give up.
This begs the question: “What are good and bad blocking effects?”
The answer is: “It depends… on what your hand wants to accomplish.”
When it comes to bluffing hands, look for these effects:
Block calls
Block folds
 Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP 

Unblock folds
 Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP 

Unblock calls
Is your bluff buff?
Let’s apply this to our river spot:
      * Good bluffs are hands like KQo with one ♥; these are fantastic combos for the big size, blocking strong flushes and calls like AK/AQ one ♥.
      * Poor bluffs are hands like 65 that don’t block the folding range, which is decent, but don’t block any strong hands. They can go into our small-betting range. They also benefit more from folding out better air, such as T8. So we don’t need to get many folds to be profitable. Pretty bad bluffs would be hands like JTs, not really blocking calls and mainly blocking villain’s folds such as AT/AJ.
Note that it isn’t always possible to be so picky. Sometimes, it’s also a question of whether you run out of (pretty) bluffs. The fewer bluffs you have to choose from, the less picky you can be.
Curious for more info on this topic, chase the rabbit here 🕳️🐇
When Being Allowed to Over-Fold the River
You might have heard about MDF (Minimum Defense Frequency). It describes the minimum amount of hands within your range that you need to defend to remain unexploitable. While this often applies, there are spots where we are allowed to over-fold relative to MDF.
Let’s look at a practical hand example to see this concept in action. We can use the same spot as before, which has the additional benefit of keeping us in familiar waters.
 Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP 

The SB 3-bettor’s river strategy vs BTN’s all-in (87% pot) on A92tt 7r 4r (after river X)
After facing a BTN all-in for 87% pot, MDF suggests that OOP must roughly defend 53.5% of their range. As we can see, though, the SB massively over-folds here by only defending 10.8% of range.
      * As we already determined, OOP’s range is highly polarized, and IP’s range mainly consists of bluff-catchers. OOP doesn’t gain anything from checking strong hands on the river because IP has no incentive to re-open marginal hands into a polarized range built around nuts or air.
 Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP 

The SB-3-bettor’s first-in river strategy filtered for 80%+ equity
By examining OOP’s best hands with more than 80% EQ, we can confirm that the SB basically never checks their strongest hands.
The BTN is now able to bluff all their air without getting punished. To be clear, the SB is not getting exploited here. They already gained their EV by polarizing on earlier streets and having no incentive to check the river with strong hands due to the polar vs condensed range dynamics. The BTN doesn’t get to float all their air on the turn, and then on the river, they just get to hammer into OOP once they check. The SB will often just bet themselves, so IP doesn’t get much opportunity to bluff. These spots where OOP over-folds the river usually occur when OOP has bet flop and turn with a highly polarized range.
Fascinating to explore because we get to see counterintuitive concepts manifest due to the nature of both ranges.
One Important River Exploit
Exploring theoretical concepts can be very helpful in grasping the complexity of particular spots. It even becomes mandatory to study theory to understand what mistakes our opponents are making and how we can capitalize on them. In practice, we always want to deviate as much as possible to capture the highest EV.
There is one spot in particular where many players leave a lot of money on the table. Instead of simply explaining the exploit, let’s do a little experiment with our nodelocking tool using custom solutions. Let’s get in the lab!
 Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP 

The SB 3-bettor’s triple barrel river strategy on K92tt 5r 8t flush-completer (after flop B33-C, turn B67-C): 200bb starting
OOP’s strategy on the nut-changing 8♦ dictates a lot of blocking. IP arrives with slightly more flushes and sets on the river. Overall, it’s a pretty decent card for the BTN.
Let’s assume we face an overly passive player who is not raising enough versus the block-bet. IP has to raise over 20% facing the small size!
Now, when we nodelock villain to raise only half of the time, by taking out especially the thin value-raises such as specific two pairs or sets. The result is an eye-opener:
 Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP 

The SB 3-bettor’s triple river strategy on K92tt 5r 8t flush-completer after nodelocking IP’s strategy:
Raise frequency vs block = ~10% instead of ~20%
We are now checking approximately 25% less and using the 2x pot all-in size 4 times as often. Pretty cool, right?
      * We check significantly less because IP is not raising enough. This means our block sizing realizes more EQ, and we are pushed less often off our hand.
      * We also use the all-in sizing considerably more because villain is not raising thin enough. Our nutted hands severely bleed EV when they are not getting raised enough. A decent heuristic is that in spots where we know villain is not raising enough, especially with thin value, we don’t want to put our strong hands into the small size.
Remember that most players in lower- and even mid-stakes games are often too passive, so this exploit will help you outplay many opponents!
Conclusion
Playing the river in 3-bet pots OOP can be tricky. This should not discourage us from seeking new knowledge to fortify our game or pursuing new abilities. The following concepts will help you in your journey to 3-bet pot river excellence as the OOP player!
      * How we constructed our ranges and influenced our opponent’s on previous streets is the foundation that a sound river approach is built upon. To avoid slipping up on how to play the river, recall the previous streets’ actions and how that shaped the ranges.
      * Using multiple sizes on earlier streets is not mandatory. The EV difference is often minimal and doesn’t make up for the increase in complexity of the game tree, which can cause EV loss itself. River splitting becomes essential in spots with different hand classes to bet. The fact that the hand ends on the river means this is our last opportunity to build a pot of a certain size, and at the same time, we do not need to worry about future complexity.
      * When we polarized on previous streets, and the river card doesn’t change the equity distributions, we can often simplify to jamming and checking at 100bb deep. The deeper we are, the more we establish multiple sizings, even on bricks.
      * We must implement one small sizing for our medium-strength hands on nut-changing runouts.
      * OOP is often allowed to over-fold in highly polarized river spots after betting flop and turn to then check the river due to the nature of both ranges.
      * In spots where we know villain is not raising enough versus our small river size, we need to take matters into our own hands. This means putting our strongest hands into our big-betting range to avoid leaving a lot of value on the table.
Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs
 Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs 

As I often like to remind readers, I am not a professional poker player; I am just a writer who is well-versed in solvers. My writing at GTO Wizard is very much colored by the perspective of a student trying to plug leaks in his own game.
With that in mind, today I am writing about a big leak I fixed in 2024. My coach, Dara O’Kearney, got me on the right track initially by explaining the error of my way, and since then, I have used GTO Wizard to really hammer the lesson home.
The leak was related to semi-bluffing.
Most bluffs should be ‘natural,’ as in they have some property that increases their chances of winning, even if it is not a ‘made’ hand.
      * Having a blocker, especially on the river, is a natural bluff as it reduces the number of combinations that can call.
      * A semi-bluff is the other type of natural bluff. This is when you bluff with a draw and if you get called, you have a good chance of improving to a very strong hand.
 The Three Laws of Indifference 

The leak I had belongs to the second category. My natural instinct was to make my biggest bluffs with my biggest draws. For example, I would only overbet-bluff or check/raise-bluff with hands such as the nut flush draw. I would rarely get too out of line with more speculative draws like gutshots or backdoor draws.
My logic was that if I were going to take on the risk of making a big bluff, I would want to have the best chance of getting there if I got action.
This, it turns out, is often backward logic. It’s probably best to jump into a hand to explain why.
Picking Semi-Bluffs on the Flop
This is an NL500 cash game example where UTG has opened, and the BTN has cold-called. The flop is J♥T♥2♣.
This is UTG’s first-in flop action:
 Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs 

 Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs 

UTG c-bet flop strategy on JT2tt vs BTN: 100bb starting, NL500
We see mostly checks from UTG, who is out of position on a board where the BTN is not a huge underdog. UTG has 54% equity overall, but the BTN has plenty of strong hands themselves, including top set.
A year ago, my instinct would be to make my bluffs the very strong draws, which on this board would be hands like A♥K♥ and A♥Q♥ for a combo draw+overcards. It would also be hands like K♥Q♥, Q♥9♥ and 9♥8♥ for the mega draw that is the open-ended straight flush draw, sometimes with strong pair outs on top.
However, looking at these hands on the grid, they are all bet less than half the time, and when we drill down further, the flush draw (i.e., heart) variant is bet the least. These are the checking frequencies of our mega draws, the hands that can turn a straight, as well as a flush if they have hearts. (I’m using the checking frequency rather than betting frequency just because there will be a mix of bet sizes, and this is an easier way to highlight overall aggression):
 Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs 

There are some outliers, K♥Q♥ for example, which is bet more than any other KQs, but the trend is quite clear.
      * If you have a flush draw (i.e., hearts) to go with your straight draw, you are betting much less often than if you just had a straight draw.
      * The other interesting thing to note is that when you have a straight draw with a backdoor flush draw (i.e., clubs), you bet the most often.
Why is this?
There are a number of reasons. Let’s first look at the equities of all the hands above:
 Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs 

In some instances, the heart combos have almost twice as much equity as their non-flush draw counterpart. In every instance, the heart combo draw has more than 50% equity, and in the case of A♥K♥ has 67.4% equity.
Can we actually call them bluffs at this point? One of the reasons these hands don’t get bet as often as the other draws is because they are too strong. We’d actually hate to bet A♥K♥ and get a fold in this spot.
To highlight this further, the most frequently bluffed hand is 97s, which is bluffed 69.5% of the time overall. It bluffs 96.2% of the time when clubs, but only 10.8% of the time when hearts. So, our most frequently bluffed hand is just a gutshot most of the time.
This all boils down to a fundamental aspect of bluffing, which is:
 Responding to BB Squeezes 

For a hand to be considered a bluff, it needs to be weak enough so that taking down the pot uncontested is one of the best possible outcomes.
These combo draws have too much equity, and we want to make sure we realize more of it, so we check to induce bets and/or see the next street.
An interesting note about why the (club) backdoor draws bluff the most. This is because they have a prospect of profitably firing second barrels on many turn cards. If they don’t turn their straight when called, they might turn a club, which means they can bluff the turn with a straight and flush draw. And in case they get reraised on the flop, it’s easy to let go of it. Practically speaking, the times they do make the club flush by the river, they have a very well-disguised hand that most real-life opponents would discount entirely.
Another way to determine why these hands rarely bluff is to look at what folds. This is the response to the 33% pot bet:
 Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs 

 Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs 

BTN response vs UTG’s 33% pot c-bet
Some small pocket pairs fold, and some Ace-x hands fold, and the rest is trash essentially. In equity terms, our combo draw range was massively ahead of all of these hands. Especially A♥K♥ and A♥Q♥, which were dominating the Ace-x and would have been very happy to turn top pair against them. The hands that fold are all hands we would have preferred to keep in the pot with our mega draw.
This was the first-in flop betting range for UTG as the OOP player. It’s a common strategy to check/raise big draws, so let’s quickly rule that out. If UTG checks, this is the BTN’s betting range:
 Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs 

 Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs 

BTN flop betting strategy vs UTG check
We won’t explore it in detail because it’s very repetitive, but the BTN has a lot of the same combo draws as UTG, and they keep to the same strategy of betting least often with straight+flush draws, and betting most with straight+backdoor flush draws.
When the BTN does bet, it is mostly an overbet, and this is the UTG response:
 Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs 

 Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs 

UTG response vs BTN’s 125% pot overbet
It’s a very narrow check/raise range. All our combo draw hands mostly call (and are calling a larger bet than we would have made if we were first to bet it).
However, the few times we do check/raise bluff with a draw, we do so at a higher frequency with the combo draw that has hearts. It’s such a small part of the range that it is almost insignificant, but as the BTN has strengthened their range by raising, we need a much stronger bluffing candidate when we reraise with a draw.
Picking Semi-Bluffs on the Turn
Let’s rewind and go back to the original strategy where UTG checks and it gets checked back to them. This is UTG’s first-in turn action:

The overall betting frequency has increased as the BTN has weakened their range by not betting. Let’s see what happens now with our combo draw hands:

On the flop, all these hands were mostly checking, but now on the turn, they are all mostly betting, including our heart combo draws, which bet more than 70% of the time. However, the heart combos still bet less often than the ones without a flush draw.
To see why, let’s once again look at the equities:
 Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs 

Most of our combo draws are now under 50% equity, averaging 43.01%. This means that they have become much more enticing to bet as they moved closer toward being a “real” bluff because we only have one card to come. The non-heart draws have, on average, 28.43% equity or less, which is why they are bluffed more often. It’s a much better result for these hands to get folds. We still don’t mind going to the river more frequently with our combo draws.
Once again, let’s look at the response to the most common bet size of 33% pot:
 Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs 

 Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs 

BTN response vs UTG’s 33% pot delayed c-bet
There is still a significant amount of raising, although a bit less than there was on the flop. The same sort of hands fold but at a higher frequency—trash, small pocket pairs, and weak Ace-x.
With one card to come, this is a much better outcome for our combo draws, even more so since there are even a few hands that continue that our higher card bluffs beat. We can “bluff” with A♥K♥ and A♥Q♥ and still get called by worse straight draws like A5s, A4s, KQs, K9s, and worse flush draws.
What if We Brick?
One last thing to explore: what happens when we get called on the turn and a brick falls on the river? I have made the river a 2♦ which is the card perhaps least likely to have helped either player.
This is the first-in river action from UTG:
 Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs 

 Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs 

UTG delayed double-barrel river strategy vs BTN on J♥T♥2♣ 3♠ 2♦ (after turn went B33-C)
And once again, let’s compare the checking frequencies to determine which of our combo draws bluff when they miss:
 Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs 

Once again, our missed flush draws check the most (i.e., they bluff the least); twice as often as the other suits, in fact.
This is a very useful heuristic to note:
Missed straight draws make better bluffs on the river than missed flush draws, most of the time.
The reason is simple: when you’re bluffing, you hope that your opponent folds. Their folding range usually contains a lot of missed flush draws, but by having a flush draw yourself, you reduce the likelihood they’ll fold. A missed straight draw, on the other hand, interferes less with the folding range, making it relatively more likely they’ll fold.
Let’s look at the response to the 132% pot bet:
 Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs 

 Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs 

BTN response vs UTG’s 132% pot bet delayed double-barrel
KQs bluffs all the time, regardless of suit; it makes for a very good bluff. It makes Ace-x and small pocket pairs fold, which is a great result. It also blocks AKo, QQ, KJs, QJs, KTs, and QTs, which all continue in some capacity.
In contrast, 87s bluffs half the time except when it is 8♥7♥. A hand like 8♦7♦ makes a good bluff because it’s almost never ahead, so any hand it makes fold was otherwise winning. It crucially unblocks missed heart draws, all of which will fold. 8♥7♥ takes a lot of heart draws out of the BTN’s range, weighting them more towards a bluff-catcher or stronger.
A quick look at the “Blockers” tab shows us this:
 Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs 

The 8♥ and 7♥ are both among the cards that lower the BTN’s folding frequency by the greatest amount.
In contrast, this is the same tab for the K and Q:
 Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs 

In some instances, having either of these cards increases the chance the BTN will fold, and even for the heart variant, the decrease in fold likelihood is quite low.
Summary
This was just one hand, but it nicely summarizes what I have been observing for the last three or four months as I fixed this semi-bluffing leak of mine.
      * It’s tempting to go all guns blazing when you have a massive draw because it is often unexploitable, and you get to put your money in as an equity favorite and give the opponent a tough decision.
      * Big combo draws, however, are actually so strong that they often consider it a pity to take the pot down immediately on the flop.
      * Bluffs, by definition, are weaker hands that are happy to take a pot down uncontested. On the flop and turn, it still helps to have outs when called, but they should also be hands that are easy to fold when raised.
      * Even though it sucks when you play such a promising hand more passively and then don’t hit any of your outs by the river, you have to be disciplined not to bluff off your stack because there are often better bluffs available in your range.
The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

One of the great modern debates in poker is GTO vs Exploitative strategy. It can be a surprisingly polarizing discussion, with each strategic methodology having devout adherents who dismiss the other.
In reality, GTO and Exploitative poker are two sides of the same coin.
      * Rational exploitative players use GTO as a means to identify leaks and as a baseline strategy to deviate from as an exploit to said leaks.
      * GTO strategy, on the flip side, is informed by potential exploits that could be used against it. It develops with the goal of avoiding unnecessary losses.
Exploitative poker is a more offensive, dynamic style that attacks vulnerabilities but does so by exposing vulnerabilities itself. The reason to fight with an open visor is that it allows to inflict greater damage and, therefore, can produce a higher win rate. However, more rewards usually come with more risk! In this case, the potential of counterexploitation. GTO poker is a more defensive, static style in the sense that it’s built around the notion of minimizing leaks as if covered by full-body armor, but the upside is capped. The reward is that it is reliably effective regardless of the opposing strategy. Note that ‘defensive’ does not imply passive. GTO can be very aggressive in its aim to conserve as much EV as possible.
 ICM and Blind Battles: The Small Blind 

The whole point I’m trying to make is that:
One can not truly understand one style of poker without understanding the other.
Today, we are going to highlight the five fundamental imbalances in poker that inform exploitative strategy. Every leak a player has will fall into one of these categories.
The five fundamental imbalances in poker are:
      * Betting Volume – The amount of money that is put into each possible line.
      * Equity management – The amount of equity that is put into each possible line.
      * Polarity – The extent to which a range is polarized between strong and weak hands.
      * Elasticity – How sensitive and adaptive someone is to bet sizing.
      * Board coverage – How well someone constructs their range in terms of the interaction with boards and board runouts.
Exploitative poker is about incentives. As we go through this list, think about how these imbalances give you incentives/reasons to lean into certain exploits.
1) Betting Volume
Betting volume refers to:
The aggregate amount of money that is bet in a certain node or series of nodes (line).
Betting Volume = ∑ (Bet Frequency × Bet Sizing)
Exploitative frameworks analyze the opponent’s strategy through the lens of betting volume: where does my opponent put the most money? A betting volume mistake is simply when someone puts too much (or too little) money in on a particular betting (or raising) line. When we categorize a player as a nit, a calling station, or a maniac, we are doing so based on a betting volume error.
Wherever an opponent’s betting volume is highest is where you want to deploy your value, especially your nutted hands. Generally speaking, your nutted hands dictate your strategy, including exploitative strategy:
      * Exploit vs over-bluffing – Checking with your value to slow-play or to check/raise.
      * Exploit vs over-callers – Betting thinner for value and sizing up with nutted hands.
      * Exploit vs over-folders – Sizing down or checking with nutted hands to avoid scaring them away too quickly and thus losing out on value. Bluffing performs better now too, due to the increased fold equity.
Let’s jump into a simple example to make things practical. We are going to use the same hand example for each type of imbalance in this article. This is BB vs CO, single-raised pot, 60bb starting stacks on a flop of 9♥6♦4♣.
The BB checks 100% of the time and this CO’s equilibrium strategy:
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

CO c-bet flop (GTO) strategy on 964r vs BB
There is a mix of checking and betting. The bet sizes mix, but they are mostly overbets or large bets, with only a small amount of 33% pot betting.
The CO’s EV is 3.7bb in GTO World. If we hover over a specific hand (e.g., T9s), these are the EVs of every line:
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

Expected values for all actions for all combinations of T9s: GTO
T9s mostly overbets but mixes all its actions because the EVs of doing so are basically the same.
But what if the BB has a betting volume leak?
We’ll lock the hand so that the BB never folds to the 33% pot bet. This is a player who thinks such a small bet is ‘weak,’ and the person who made it can be outplayed later in the hand. We changed the frequency of folding to zero and let GTO Wizard AI decide how the range calls or raises:
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

BB’s nodelocked (by frequency) response vs CO’s 33% pot c-bet
We also locked the 100% check at the start of the hand. You’ll know why if you read our Limits of Nodelocking article. With all that information in mind, let’s see what effect this has on the CO’s c-betting strategy:
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

CO’s c-bet flop (exploitative) strategy on 964r vs BB
The CO has gone from a mixed strategy, which rarely bets small, to betting small 100% of the time. Even very strong hands like sets and overpairs have gone for the small sizing.
Revisiting T9s specifically shows an average EV of ~7.2bb for overbetting, but the average EV of betting 33% pot is even higher at ~8.6bb.
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

Expected values for all actions for all combinations of T9s: Exploitative
There is a clear betting volume error here! ❌ The BB is putting too much money in against the 33% pot bet line, so the CO is incentivized to use that sizing for their entire range. The no-fold vs bet dynamic allows them to grow the pot they are favored to win on the flop without losing practically any of their advantages on the turn (depending on the new card). Even very weak hands like J5s are beating enough of the BB’s calling range to justify doing this. Bear in mind that this is despite the fact that the BB will pay off overbets. Even the very strong hands that normally are incentivized to overbet, like overpairs and top pair, are choosing the small bet line because they are guaranteed to be called.
At the start of the hand, the CO makes 3.75bb in GTO world, but with the nodelocked strategy, they make 4.71bb overall, which is a significant increase.
2) Equity Management
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

Equity management in poker refers to:
How a player manages all their possible hands, which come from a varying set of equity buckets.
This topic can be divided into two parts:
      * Nut allocation – What do they do with their nutted, high-equity hands?
Do they bet small, do they overbet, or do they check? Do they bluff with their lowest-equity hands or turn made hands into bluffs?
      * Hand appraisal – How do they value different hand classes?
Some players play top pair the same way others play a set. Some players massively overvalue Ace-x type hands or have a fondness for small suited connectors. There are players who will be quite nitty with top pair, but happy to commit everything with a high-equity draw.
An equity management error would be over- or under-valuing a certain hand class. Classic practical examples of this include over-calling with weak pairs or missing thin value.
Let’s go back to that 9♥6♦4♣ hand. When the CO does overbet, this is the BB’s GTO response:
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

BB’s (GTO) response vs CO’s 125% pot c-bet
There is a small (~6%) check/raising range. The value is mostly top pair or two pair, the bluffs are mostly gutshots or backdoor draws. Sets just call, as do the open-ended straight draws.
An equity management error would be over-bluffing in this spot. Let’s nodelock this so that the BB check/raises their open-ended straight draws 100% of the time, and their gutshots or backdoor draws 50% of the time.
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

BB’s (nodelocked: semi-bluff-heavy) response vs CO’s 125% pot c-bet
They now raise ~23% of the time. If you are following along in GTO Wizard itself, remember to lock the range first. Otherwise the solver will increase the number of hands that check/raise for value to compensate for the imbalance.
Let’s compare how the response changed to optimize against this check/raise, which is now way heavier in semi-bluffs. This is the CO’s original GTO response:
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

CO’s (GTO) response vs BB’s balanced check/raise
This is how CO reacts in the nodelocked simulation:
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

CO’s (exploitative) response vs BB’s imbalanced check/raise
In GTO world, the CO should fold ~38% of the time, but in the nodelocked solution, folding is out of the question. They are not incentivized to call either, exclusively raising to exploit the range with too many bluffs in it. Two raise sizes are used, with the shoves being heavier on top pair and the non-all-in raising range skewing toward second pair.
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

Range breakdowns: left = Raise 124% (all-in), right = Raise 66%
In the GTO example, the CO’s raises are carefully picked. When it is 9-x, it is either A9 or K9, which outkick many pairs of 9-x that call, or T9s/98s/97s, which can all make straights or flushes by the river. The bluffs are broadway overcards like JTs and QTs, which can make runner-runner straights or flushes and also have pair outs against 9-x. In the nodelocked example, we just raise pretty much everything because the BB’s range is too bluff-heavy. This is a recurring theme in exploitative poker strategy:
When your opponent is very out of balance, the need to carefully curate your own range to maintain a delicate balance disappears as well.
Most of the time, you can just do what your hand is incentivized to do.
         * At the start of the hand, the CO makes ~3.7bb on average in GTO World.
         * In this nodelocked example, they make ~4.5bb on average.
3) Polarity
Polarity in poker refers to:
The degree to which a range is polarized between strong and weak hands or more condensed toward middling hands.
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

A polarity imbalance essentially refers to not understanding range morphology and using the incorrect strategy for the shapes of the ranges. Is your opponent representing a polarized range with lots of nuts and bluffs or a more merged range with lots of medium-strength hands and draws?
Having a capped range but taking the betting lead would be an example of this imbalance. Betting small with a polarized range or overbetting with a condensed range would be another example.
The exploit for a polarity imbalance depends on the direction of the imbalance:
         * If an opponent has a capped or too condensed range, you should attack that range with big sizings because that’s how you extract the most value from such a range.
         * If your opponent has a too polarized range, you want to attack them with small bet sizes because polar ranges struggle to call, so a small bet will force them to raise or over-fold.
With the caveat that if they are perfectly polarized (they only have the nuts or a pure bluff) you do not want to attack them. Instead, you should bluff-catch against them because otherwise, they will only continue against you with the nuts.
Once again, looking at that 9♥6♦4♣ hand. A reminder that this is the CO response to a check at equilibrium:
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

CO c-bet (GTO) flop strategy on 964r vs BB
Around 42% of hands check. Some top pair hands check for protection, but mostly, the checking range is made up of lower pairs and Ace-high. A hand like 86s currently has good equity but preserves less of it against the calling range, so it is incentivized to check.
A polarity error here would be for the CO to range-bet with its rather polarized range. This is a common mistake, especially by players from the early days of online who were once able to auto-profit by c-betting every flop purely. This is how the solver adjusts CO’s strategy when we take away the option to check:
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

CO’s adjusted c-bet flop strategy when check is not allowed
In the below node comparison, the BB’s responses to the overbet are contrasted:
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

BB responses facing an overbet: exploitative (left) vs GTO (right)
The first thing to note is that there is significantly less folding in the nodelocked example. The BB folds ~48% of the time compared to ~58% of the time. The other notable difference is the doubling of the check/raising frequency. This is a common combination of exploits:
When somebody bets too often, you are incentivized to let them make that mistake, and then either bluff-catch wider or pounce with extra check/raises.
At the start of the hand, the BB has a theoretical EV of ~2.1bb. In the nodelocked example, they make ~2.2bb in exploitative EV. Not a huge increase, but magnified over a large sample it is a ~10bb/100 error.
4) Elasticity
Elasticity in poker refers to:
How sensitive and adaptive a player is to bet sizing, aka pricing.
High elasticity means they are very sensitive to pricing, and low elasticity means they are insensitive to pricing.
A satellite winner playing their first ever WSOP Main Event might be too elastic to pricing and over-fold because of fear of busting out. Indeed, every year, amateurs discuss the merits of folding AA preflop in the first level if another player goes all-in. The fear of busting is so great that it trumps the massive +EV proposition of getting $10,000 in the middle as a more than 80% favorite. This is the quintessential ‘scared money’ stereotype.
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

A wealthy player gambling at stakes that are too low for them is a classic example of a player with a too inelastic leak. These players will call all-ins with any two cards for fun and are immune to bluffing.
You know the drill by now, let’s get out that 9♥6♦4♣ board once more. This was the CO response vs a balanced check from BB:
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

CO c-bet (GTO) flop strategy on 964r vs BB
This is a classic overbetting spot because the CO has a polarized range. They either have a very strong hand relative to this flop (top pair or better) or have missed this flop completely.
This is what the BB should do when the overbet is made:
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

BB’s (GTO) response vs CO’s 125% pot c-bet
Plenty of folding, but the BB has to call with hands as weak as Ace-high to avoid being exploited.
What if, however, the BB is over-sensitive to pricing and would never call an overbet with second pair or lower?
This is what the CO does when checked to on the flop when we lock in the above leak:
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

CO c-bet (exploitative) flop strategy on 964r vs (over-sensitive: over-fold to 125% pot) BB
The CO has gone from betting ~58% of the time to betting ~76% of the time. They have also stopped using the 82% bet size altogether. Their overbetting frequency jumped up from 52% to 66% of the time.
With BB being over-sensitive to pricing, expressed as over-folding to overbets, CO is incentivized to increase the frequency of overbets.
A more curious adjustment is that the 33% bet size also sees an increase in frequency (from 3% to 9%). This is because some hands in the range really do not want the BB to over-fold. In particular, the sets adopt this strategy when they overbet a lot of the time at equilibrium. 99, for example, makes around 14.5bb whether it is checked, small bet, or overbet in the unlocked GTO solution. In this nodelocked example, it only makes ~10.5bb as an overbet but ~13.8bb as a small bet.
Let’s switch gears and observe what happens when we model the BB as price-insensitive by having them call any pair and Ace-high too.
This is a gambler that over-calls to overbets. Given the assumed elasticity error, this is how the CO plays after they check flop:
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

CO c-bet (exploitative) flop strategy on 964r vs (price-insensitive) BB
The frequency of betting has not significantly changed from the GTO example, but now the betting range is exclusively overbet. If Villain is not folding to the biggest bet size, we may as well use that size with all our value.
            * In the GTO example, at the start of the hand, the BB made ~2.1bb on average.
            * In both nodelocked examples, they made ~1.85bb in the price-sensitive example and ~1.8bb in the price-insensitive example.
5) Board Coverage
Board coverage in poker refers to
The ability to make strong hands across a wide range of possible board textures.
Balanced ranges have board coverage, meaning they can potentially hit any flop. Most opening ranges contain most of the suited Ace-x hands, such as A3s, because they are an economical way to achieve board coverage. A tight opening range can still hit a 3♥2♦3♦ flop because it was constructed with board coverage in mind.
Board coverage isn’t limited to the flop; it also has an aspect of runout coverage. An easy-to-digest example is when there is a potential flush draw on the flop. We want to have flush draws both when we check and when we bet, so when the turn brings a flush-completing card, we can represent it in both scenarios.
A board coverage error is made when a line is over- or under-saturated with certain types of hands. When a player never c-bets with Ace-high on the flop, they should generate fewer folds when they barrel on a turned Ace. When a player never checks back a pair, they can more easily be pushed off a hand when the turn pairs the board.
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

Oh look who it is, it’s that 9♥6♦4♣ hand from earlier. In the unlikely case you forgot, here’s a reminder of the GTO flop strategy for the CO when checked to:
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

Let’s say the flop goes check-check, and the turn is an A♠. This is the first action from the BB:
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

BB’s (GTO) first in turn strategy vs CO’s flop check
There is a small amount of leading because the CO has weakened their range by checking, but most of the time, the BB checks again.
What if we updated the CO’s c-bet strategy so that they always bluffed with Ace-high, at a variety of sizings?
When the flop checks through now and the A♠ turn comes, the BB’s adjustment looks as follows:
 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

 The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker 

BB’s (exploitative) first in turn strategy vs CO’s nodelocked flop check
The BB has gone from leading 6% of the time to leading 70% of the time. Why?
By betting all of their Ace-x on the flop, the checking CO has a capped turn-range when the Ace shows on fourth street. In the GTO example, the CO checked a lot of Ace-x hands on the flop, which gave them runout coverage for an Ace coming on the turn. However, in this example, the BB knows the CO cannot have top pair, so they punish them by betting a lot.
The issues caused by a board coverage error manifest when the under-represented board card is dealt. In the example above, when the Ace turns up, the CO is unable to represent that card, so much so that the BB can attack with leads around 70% of the time. Alternatively, the CO loses the implied odds when they hit the Ace on the turn when the flop goes check-bet-call, because now they have too many Ace-x hands, and will not get paid off.
This is why we mix our actions, so we can represent value (and bluffs) on every possible runout in every possible line.
Board coverage imbalances give attentive players a form of clairvoyance that allows them to tell when a card has (or has not) improved their opponent.
            * In GTO world, on the turn, the CO makes ~3.8bb on average.
            * In the nodelocked example, their expected value drops to ~2.4bb.
Conclusion
This is a starting guide to exploitative poker. Any leak you notice at the table, every play that deviates from GTO, will have one of these imbalances. Of course, it could be the case that a player has multiple imbalances at the same time. A tight player may under-bluff (see equity management) and not have any low suited Ace-x hands like A3s (see board coverage). A loose player might always c-bet every board, even the ones where they have a polarized range (see polarity) and never fold to reraises (see (in)elasticity).
The nodelocking feature of GTO Wizard AI will show you how to adapt to these players. It can also show you what the EV is of a line in a GTO context compared to playing against the specific suboptimal opponent that you modeled. The severity of an error is really worth paying attention to, as we have seen above, some errors are more costly than others.

The Art of Bluff Catching
 The Art of Bluff Catching 

Bluff catching—calling a bet with a modest hand which you expect to win only if your opponent is bluffing—is not a significant source of profit in most situations. It is often a roughly breakeven proposition against a well-constructed betting range, and even when it is profitable, it tends to be only by a slim margin.
Bluff catching is not a significant source of profit.
Much of the strategy in big bet poker games like No-Limit Hold’em and Pot Limit Omaha revolves around not ending up in spots where you’re making decisions about whether to call or fold with a bluff catcher in the first place. If you’re torn between calling and folding, then the EV of both options must be similar, which means your hand is basically worthless no matter which you choose.
In this article, we will investigate why bluff catching is so unappealing, how to handle bluff catching decisions when you end up in a tough spot, and how to avoid ending up in that tough spot in the first place.
When Bluff Catching is Worthless
Perhaps you’ve heard of the AKQ game (sometimes called the Clairvoyance Game). In this toy game, both players are dealt a single card from a deck containing one Ace, one King, and one Queen. They ante and are allowed to bet as they could in a real poker game. If the hand goes to showdown, the player with the highest card wins.
Because hands never change value in this game, it is analogous to playing the river in hold ‘em. By analyzing how bluff catching works in this game and how much it is (not) worth, we can better understand bluff catching on the river in real poker situations. Then we can work backwards to think about bluff catching on earlier streets.
 Counterintuitive Calls 

First, let’s think about the decisions you could face holding each card in the AKQ game:
            * Queen – This is the nut low. It will never win at showdown. You would never call a bet with this hopeless hand. The only decision is whether to bluff or resign yourself to losing at showdown.
            * Ace – This is the nuts. When in position, you always bet. But even with the nuts, you can face a tricky decision when out of position. You could bet, hoping your opponent will call with a bluff catcher, or check, hoping they will bluff.
            * King – This is your bluff catcher. That doesn’t mean you should definitely call bets with it, but calling is a legitimate option with a chance of winning the pot. What you should never do with this hand, however, is bet it. Unless your opponent fundamentally misunderstands the game, they will never fold the nuts nor call with the nut low, so betting accomplishes nothing.
So, you get one easy decision with a bluff catcher (King): you always check it. If you are last to act, there’s nothing to worry about. You go straight to showdown and find out whether your hand is good. If not, you may have a tough decision if your opponent bets, but they are not necessarily going to bet, so you sometimes get a free showdown even after checking (and always win since your opponent would never check an Ace).
 How to solve toy games 

If you’re interested in the details, the GTO Wizard blog has an entire article dedicated to solving variations of this game. The bottom line is that there is no correct answer whether to bluff with a Queen or bluff catch with a King. The GTO/unexploitable strategy for both hands is a mix of both options. With a King, the strategy is to always check and to call bets to reach Minimum Defense Frequency—a frequency of calls that makes your opponent indifferent to bluffing.
An unexploitable GTO strategy is not intrinsically profitable. It could even be money-losing!
It is essential to understand that these calls are not intrinsically profitable. They could even be money-losing! These calls’ profitability—or lack thereof—depends on your opponent’s bluffing frequency. If they bluff too much, your calls are profitable. If they don’t bluff enough, these calls lose money (but you make up the difference elsewhere by sometimes winning at showdown when you would have folded to a bluff).
This unexploitable calling frequency is the optimal strategy only when you have no insight into how your opponent will play.
The fact that you are mixing between calls and folds means the two must have the same EV, which must be $0 since that is always the EV of folding (in a Chip EV environment). This is why bluff catching is worthless: even if your opponent bluffs when they’re supposed to, and you get your calling frequency precisely right, you still don’t make any more money than you would have if you had folded.
Bluff Catching on the River
In real hold ‘em situations, this dynamic is easiest to see on the river. Here’s an example where BB calls a raise from UTG in a 100bb cash game, checks and calls 76% pot on the A♥T♦6♥ flop and 125% pot on the 4♠ turn, then checks and faces an all-in bet for just over 200% pot on the 2♥ river.
 The Art of Bluff Catching 

Boxes appear on this grid as either fully green for hands which always call, fully blue for hands which always fold, or a mix of blue and green for hands which sometimes call and sometimes fold. That “sometimes” can mean one of two things: it may be that the hand either purely calls or purely folds depending on suits, or it may be that the hand is indifferent between calling and folding—the equivalent of a K in the AKQ game.
The pure calls—the ones that are profitable rather than breakeven bluff catchers—are mostly flushes. The T9s and T8s that call are flushes, not second pair. T6s, which makes two pair, is a pure fold.
There are some pure calls from other hands, though it’s tough to tell from the grid. A9 and AT always fold without a heart but always call when they have one:
 The Art of Bluff Catching 

This is not true for all the Ace-x, however. AQ always folds without the Q♥ but is indifferent with it:
 The Art of Bluff Catching 

The above grid shows Call with an EV of .01, but that’s just a convergence error. If calling were actually more profitable than folding, even by a tiny fraction, the solver would call every time.
Not even all flushes are profitable bluff catchers. Check out the strategy for 5♥ 3♥:
 The Art of Bluff Catching 

Not even all flushes are profitable bluff catchers.
What’s going on here? Why is the solver folding some two pair and sometimes even a flush but calling with some top pair?
When Bluffcatching is Worthwhile
Three factors could make calling this river shove profitable rather than breakeven:
            * You expect to beat some of UTG’s value bets. In this case, your hand is not even technically a bluff catcher because the value of the call doesn’t only come from beating bluffs. With a pure bluff catcher, the sort that’s indifferent to calling, the money you expect to win from bluffs is exactly equal to the money you expect to lose to value bets. When you call with J♥ 4♥, you aren’t a lock to win, but you will win more, on average, than you lose because you beat all the bluffs plus the occasional lower flush.
            * You block more value hands than bluffs. When UTG shoves, they either have a flush or they are bluffing. This is why top pair is not necessarily worse for calling than two pair, a set or even a low flush. All these hands beat bluffs equally well and lose to all the same flushes. When you hold the T♥, however, you have secret information. You know your opponent does not hold T♥ 8♥, but they do not know you know that. They therefore bluff at a higher frequency, as if they could have T♥ 8♥ and similar hands. You profit from all those bluffs while knowing you won’t be shown the value hands as often as you would with a worse bluff catcher.
            * You expect your opponent to bluff too often. To make your bluff catchers indifferent to calling, your opponent must bluff exactly in proportion to the pot odds their bet offers. If they bluff too much, all your bluff catches become (slightly) profitable. If they bluff too little, then you lose money by bluff catching.
 Flop Heuristics: OOP C-Betting in MTTs 

This third point is exploitative in nature. It requires you to wager on a belief about your opponent’s strategy. If your belief is correct, you do better than you would with an unexploitable calling strategy. If it is incorrect, you do worse.
You won’t always be able to make such a prediction, but when you are, it can easily override the first two points. If your opponent does not bluff enough, you could lose money not only by calling with pure bluff catchers, but even by calling with hands that have good blocking effects or that beat a few hands they thought they were betting for value.
This is because bluff catching, even when you have the ideal catcher against an opponent who bluffs perfectly, is just not that profitable. The best-case scenario usually gains EV equal to only a tiny fraction of what you risk on the call.
You also are not guaranteed profitable bluff catches, even at equilibrium, just because you meet the above criteria. Remember that AQ with the Q♥, in our example, mixed calls and folds despite blocking some value hands. This was partly because it also blocked some bluffs—the Q♥ is also a good blocker for UTG to hold when they bluff. Blockers are often easy enough to come by and have a marginal enough effect that an equilibrium bluffing strategy makes you indifferent to calling when you have them and strictly prefer folding when you don’t.
Bluff Catching Before the River
The biggest difference between real poker and the AKQ game is that hands can change value from street to street. Before the river, this is often the most important factor when considering whether to call with a bluff catcher: could this hand improve to something nutty?
This comes back to the idea that you want to avoid ending up in a marginal spot where you’re making decisions about whether to call or fold with a bluff catcher. You don’t want a K in the AKQ game; you want an A. Sometimes, in pursuit of an A, you end up with a K. When that happens, you must make the best of it. But the chance of improving to an A is worth a lot.
Could this hand improve to something nutty?
Here is BB’s turn strategy facing a 125% pot bet on A♥T♦6♥4♠:
 The Art of Bluff Catching 

With the exception of AQ and AK, which beat some value hands, top pair is indifferent between calling and folding. Nut flush draws always fold unless they have a straight draw as well. Yet lower flush draws with a pair like 5♥ 4♥ and Q♥ T♥ never fold. Despite being lower ranked and having worse blockers than A9, these hands always call (or raise). Neither the draw nor the bluff catching value alone is enough to make calling profitable. It is the combination of improving to a flush or showing down the best hand unimproved that gets these hands over the line.
In fact, BB starts folding top pair as early as the flop when they don’t have a significant redraw to go along with it. Notice that A5 is indifferent to calling the 76% pot continuation bet unless it also has a backdoor flush draw:
 The Art of Bluff Catching 

You may be more familiar with this concept than you realize. Suppose you’re on the button preflop, facing a raise from UTG. Would you rather call with 87s or K7o? It could go the other way if the bet were all-in, but with money behind, you probably prefer the 87s. K7o is a (slightly) above-average hand preflop, but it rarely turns into anything nutty. It often misses the flop entirely, and when it does hit, it makes tough-to-play hands like bottom pair or top pair with a bad kicker. 87s may be the lower-ranked hand, but its potential to turn into a straight or flush makes it a better candidate for playing after the flop.
It is never too soon to fold top pair.
The same principle applies when you’re facing flop and turn bets. The more money remaining to be wagered, the more you should concern yourself with what the hand could turn into on later streets rather than its current rank. Contrary to popular belief, there is no prize for being ahead on the flop, nor is it “too soon” to fold top pair.
Practical Bluff Catching
 How ICM Impacts Restealing From The Blinds 

What makes these two cards good for calling?
            * Start with a rough sense of how often you ought to continue. This is primarily a function of the bet size relative to the pot—you should be more stubborn facing smaller bets—and range dynamics. If you started with a weaker range than your opponent because of the action on earlier streets, then it is correct to fold more often. You may wish to factor in exploitative assumptions here as well. If you think your opponent will rarely bluff, then you should fold more often.
            * Identify your never-folds. These are mostly either hands strong enough to beat some of your opponent’s value bets, or draws to nutty hands, though as we have seen, the draws alone may not be sufficient when facing large bets. You may call or raise with these hands—both “punish” your opponent’s bluffs—but you know you are not folding them.
            * Identify additional bluff catching candidates as needed. If (and only if) the hands you identified in Step Two do not get you up to the point you wanted to be in Step One, then you search for additional bluff catchers. Look for hands with good blocking effects or potential to improve on future streets. Ideally, a combination of both.
            * Gut check. Before you click ‘call‘ or push chips into the pot, articulate to yourself why you are calling with this hand. Your answer should not be something generic like “my opponent could be bluffing” because that’s got nothing to do with your cards. It’s a reason you should have a calling range, but it doesn’t tell you anything about whether your current hand belongs in that range. What makes these two cards good for calling?
Planning Ahead
 Delayed C-Betting 

The “gut check” described in Step Four above is especially valuable because it can help with future bluff catching decisions. For instance, when you articulate why you are calling the turn, you also plan ahead for the river.
When you articulate why you are calling the turn, you also plan ahead for the river.
Let’s return to that A♥ T♦ 6♥ 4♠ board again. When you call the turn with Q♥ T♥, you are looking for one of two things. First, you are looking for a river card that helps you. A flush would be ideal, but even a Queen or Ten would give you enough equity to call a river bet. Second, you are looking for your opponent to check behind. If they do, you will occasionally win unimproved. If neither of those things happens—if you whiff the river and your opponent bets again—then you fold.
Sure, it’s possible your opponent could be bluffing. But remember that you have different hands in your range to choose from, hands that did improve on this river or have better blockers, to pick off those bluffs. This hand’s job is not to catch those bluffs. This hand’s job is to dodge value bets by folding.
Or, consider A♦ 5♦ on the flop. Why are you calling the flop bet with this hand? “Because I have top pair” is not a helpful answer. It tells you nothing about what you will do on later streets. You’re calling because you might pick up a diamond draw on the turn, or your opponent might check the turn, or they might bet small enough for your blocker to be relevant. If none of those things happens—if you whiff and your opponent overbets—then you fold even though they could easily be bluffing.
 Playing Limped Pots as the SB in MTTs 

One of the ways you catch bluffs is by re-bluffing.
Let’s try one more. Why is J♥ 8♥ calling the flop? First and foremost, it’s hoping for some improvement on the turn. A heart would be ideal, but picking up a pair or even a straight draw will probably be enough to call another bet. Failing those things, it’s hoping for a check so it can either improve on the river or bluff.
That’s right: one of the ways you “catch” bluffs is by re-bluffing. That could mean raising the current street or calling and bluffing later, should the right circumstances occur. Bluffing is not especially profitable, but then again, neither is bluff catching.
This is yet another reason why a good draw with a backup plan of bluffing is better than a marginal made hand that will rarely be useful for anything but bluff catching on later streets. Either way, your backup plan isn’t worth much. At least the draw has the potential to turn into something valuable.
Conclusion
Bluff catching is not primarily about the rank of your hand. The only reason a hand would be “too strong to fold” would be if it beats hands your opponent could be value betting. If your opponent’s range is polarized around your hand—if you lose to all their value bets and beat all their bluffs—then your top pair catches bluffs just as well as sets do.
On the river, bluff catching decisions mostly come down to what you block or unblock.
Before the river, a hand’s potential to improve is a major factor, to such a degree that draws are sometimes better calling candidates than top pair!
But reads can trump all of these considerations. Before you worry about blockers and Minimum Defense Frequency, consider whether you even want to bluff catch against this player in this spot. The best-case scenarios are rarely very profitable, and in the worst-case scenarios, calling big river bets with bluff catchers is lighting money on fire.
If you’re not careful, everything you learn about game theory, blockers, and exploitability can be twisted into excuses for fishy calls. You should be at least as worried about whether calling is exploitable, as you are about whether folding is exploitable.
Navigating Nasty Rivers Out of Position
 Navigating Nasty Rivers as OOP 

Playing out of position (OOP) is hard. It’s fundamentally disadvantageous to act on each street without knowing your opponent’s action while they get to act with knowledge of yours. This disadvantage is especially acute on dynamic rivers. When the final community card makes new monster hands possible, it also devalues previously strong holdings. Hands with which you were happily growing the pot on the flop and turn may suddenly prefer a cheap showdown.
Unfortunately, to get that cheap showdown, you have to check or bet small, which risks telegraphing your desire to your opponent. They can then bet or raise a polarized range, leaving you in a pickle. Game theory is not a magic bullet solution to this difficulty. Solvers lose money out of position just like humans do. But they lose as little as possible because they can balance their ranges to minimize the information they leak with their actions.
In this article, we will investigate how solvers strike this balance and extrapolate heuristics to help you better handle these extremely tricky situations.
Prevention > Treatment
The best way to handle a messy situation is to avoid ending up in it in the first place. When you foresee a tough spot on the horizon, the best way to minimize the damage is to keep the pot small.
How do solvers avoid messy situations?
1) Tight opening ranges from Early Position
Tight opening ranges from Early Position, emphasizing suited hands. One pair is the hand class most susceptible to getting “shipwrecked” by a bad river card. Suited starting hands still turn into one pair more often than they turn into anything else, but they at least have the potential to make a flush. This UTG opening range from a 9-handed 100bb cash game illustrates how solvers open only the very best offsuit hands from early position but are more liberal with suited (and, to a lesser extent, connected) hands:

2) Rarely flatting open-raises in Early Position
Rarely flatting open-raises in Early Position. A “no-flop, no-drop“ rake structure is the biggest incentive for aggressive 3-betting in cash games. But even in an unraked game, solvers rarely call raises in early position and prefer suited hands when they do so. Calls invite players with better position to squeeze or call behind you, forcing you to play out of position after the flop. Here’s a HJ strategy facing a 2bb LJ open in an unraked, 100bb cash game:

HJ defense vs LJ 2bb open-raise in an unraked, 100bb cash game
3) Rarely c-betting from OOP
Rarely c-betting from out of position. This LJ vs BTN 100bb cash game single-raised pot (SRP) flop report shows LJ c-betting less than ⅓ of the time on aggregate with a strong preference for betting on less connected flops:

LJ vs BTN in a 100bb cash game SRP: LJ’s average flop action frequencies + tendencies based on Connectedness
When OOP on a dynamic board, you may not be favored to win the pot, even when you flop a strong hand.
Some of this is a function of how the equity is distributed on various flop textures, but it also reflects the fact that growing pots, even with currently strong hands, is more dangerous on connected boards where a new card could more easily devalue your hand. Because you can anticipate being disadvantaged on many river decisions, you may not be favored to win the pot, even when you flop a strong hand.
Flush draws on the flop have a similar but less dramatic effect on OOP’s c-betting strategy:

LJ’s average strategic flop tendencies based on Suits
4) 3-betting larger from OOP
3-betting larger from out of position. Facing a 2bb UTG open in a 100bb 6-handed cash game, the solver uses a 7.5bb 3-bet on the BTN, a 10bb 3-bet from the SB, and a 12bb 3-bet from the BB. Larger 3-bets make it more likely you will take the pot down preflop, eliminating the risk of tricky turn and river decisions. They also reduce the SPR in the event you are called, making it easier to stack off with modest hands and/or get all the money in before the river. Even so, we once again see the solver’s preference for suited hands when contesting a pot from out of position:

Arriving on the River
Does it seem strange that this article about tricky river decisions has so far exclusively discussed preflop and flop decisions? That’s no accident! You should think of your early street range construction as building the foundation upon which your later street decisions will rest. If you build a flimsy foundation, one that will be lopsided and wobbly on many rivers, then of course it’s going to collapse.
What follows is advice for how to make the best of a bad river situation, assuming you arrive there with the right kind of range. If your range is lopsided—if you have too many weak-to-medium holdings and not enough nuts, for instance—this isn’t going to be enough to bail you out.
Early street ranges are the foundation for later street decisions.
This hand begins with UTG playing an SRP heads up against BTN in a 100bb full ring MTT. On a flop of K♠J♥5♦, UTG c-bets 33% pot as the solver would with 72% of its range (this is an especially good flop for UTG). They follow through with an 83% pot bet on an 8♦ turn and then get a T♦ river, completing both the 4-out straight draws from the flop and the backdoor flush draw.
This isn’t necessarily a nightmare, assuming you arrive at the river with a reasonable range and play it well. The solver expects UTG to have a significant equity advantage and to slightly over-realize (104%) that equity:
 Navigating Nasty Rivers as OOP 

UTG vs BTN river breakdown
That’s mostly a holdover from the big equity and nuts advantage they enjoyed after the turn action. Other rivers are even more favorable, with the T♣ offering 113.7% EQR and the very blank 2♣ 110.9% EQR. And parts of UTG’s range will suffer, as they are no longer the monsters they once were. This includes not just one pair hands like AK and AA but even sets!
 Navigating Nasty Rivers as OOP 

Equity realization of UTG’s river range on K♠J♥5♦ 8♦ T♦
Those equity realization numbers are best-case scenarios. They rely upon precise balancing to avoid excessive vulnerability on any branch of the game tree. This includes the “Check” and “Bet 10%” lines, which are especially tricky to balance and so often correctly perceived as weak.
Because this is such a tricky spot, it will be harder than usual for us mere mortals to achieve the solver’s theoretical EV. But we can get close by deriving heuristics from the solver’s strategies.
Don’t Give Up Now
It’s easy (and correct) to imagine all the ways this river card may have helped your opponent. Just keep in mind they will be imagining the same thing about you. Your range for betting flop and turn should consist mostly of strong made hands and strong draws, so on a river that completes all your obvious draws, it will be hard to find weak hands to bluff with. In the event that you do have one, you should go for it!
 Navigating Nasty Rivers as OOP 

UTG’s river strategy displayed as a Manhattan graph
The solver purely bets its worst hands, indicating they are profitable rather than breakeven bluffs. The only weak hands mixing checks are those with a shred of showdown value or blockers to the opponent’s folding range (usually both, since middle pair type hands are an important part of the folding range).
Set Traps
Did you notice, on the above Manhattan graph, there are also a lot of checks and small bets at the top end of Hero’s range? Those are important! You’re going to be checking and block betting a lot of genuinely vulnerable hands, creating an incentive for your opponent to attack with big bets and raises. This, in turn, incentivizes you to include some nutted hands in those ranges to profit from that aggression.
 Navigating Nasty Rivers as OOP 

UTG’s river strategy with flushes
The best traps block hands that would call a large bet.
The solver distributes flushes across all its ranges (the biggest bet sizes are not used by any hand). But the distribution is not arbitrary. Some are better for betting, and some for trapping.
The best traps are hands that block the opponent’s calling range, which is heavy on King-x and big diamonds. These hands are unlikely to get called when they bet big, so they check or bet small instead.
Don’t Bet Too Big
UTG’s big bet on the turn was designed to set up big, polar river bets. On a blank river, overbets are a significant part of their strategy. This is because BTN’s range is largely capped after just calling the flop and turn, and a blank river does nothing to change that.
This is not a blank river, however. It uncaps BTN, promoting enough draws and medium-strength hands to monsters that UTG no longer possesses the kind of nuts advantage that would incentivize big, polar bets. So, the largest size they use is 86% pot, despite having nearly 3x pot remaining in the effective stacks.
 Navigating Nasty Rivers as OOP 

Equity distribution on the river: K♠J♥5♦ 8♦ T♦
UTG’s largest advantage is located in the middle of the equity distribution, so they focus their attack there via medium-sized bets, even when they have the nuts.
Checking Is Not Giving Up
You’re going to find yourself in a lot of awkward, uncomfortable spots when a “scary” river card lands. That’s what makes it scary. Some of your hands will under-realize their equity, which is another way of saying you’re going to sometimes fold the winner or pay off when behind. But take a breath; all is not lost.
Your opponent is not necessarily always going to pounce on your checks and block bets with big bets or raises. They don’t know whether you’re checking to fold, checking to call, or even checking to raise. Sometimes, they will have a slightly weaker medium-strength hand of their own and be content to take a cheap showdown along with you. That’s where most of the value of checking comes from.
Because you’re checking some nutty hands hoping to raise for value, you can also check-raise some bluffs. These are refreshingly easy to find:
 Navigating Nasty Rivers as OOP 

When checking AK, you are not necessarily checking to bluff. Your hand has showdown value, and you will sometimes win a checked-down pot. Only when your opponent bets does your hand lose its value. Even then, if you have a diamond, your hand is a candidate for calling to beat bluffs or raising to push Villain off two pair and sets (their thinner value bets).
A Block Bet Is Basically a Check… or Is It?
Checking or betting 10% of the pot is virtually the same thing here. Both put very little money into the pot, and your opponent should respond similarly to either, by betting or raising roughly the same hands for the same size and calling most of the same hands they would have checked back. Everything mentioned above about which hands to check and how to respond to a bet applies to block betting as well.
When you’re in position, it’s a different story because a bet re-opens the action and exposes you to a raise, while a check guarantees you a showdown. From out of position, your block betting range should in theory be slightly stronger than your checking range, but it’s a tiny difference.
Unless your opponent handles one worse than the other. We’re getting into exploitative territory here, so proceed at your own risk. If you can predict your opponent’s response in one of the following exploitable ways, you can adjust your ranges to increase your profit:
            * Over-folding to small bets. This doesn’t have to entail folding anything good. Some players are just much more willing to bet than to raise. If they don’t bluff raise, they will end up folding too much because they won’t have “anything good” often enough. This means you should shift your weak hands into the small bet range to profit from these folds, and also that you should trap with your strong hands by checking rather than block betting.
            * Under-folding to small bets. Even getting 11:1, it is occasionally correct for your opponent to fold. Some egos can’t handle that though. These players take the small bet as a personal insult and call and raise too aggressively as a result. Exploit them by never bluffing with this line, moving more traps into your block bet range, and bluff catching more often when they raise.
 Using New Skills at the Poker Table 

            * Failing to raise for thin value. Your opponent does not need a flush to raise your block bet. Two pair is good enough, just as it would be good enough to value bet after you check. Against players who won’t raise without the near-nuts, block betting is preferable to checking with all your medium hands. It enables you to squeeze a little more value when ahead while facing fewer tough decisions when raised (not necessarily because the decision is easier—your opponent’s raising range could still make you indifferent to calling—but simply because they will raise less often).
Conclusion
Playing out of position is always tough, even if you’re a solver. It’s especially tough when the board texture changes dramatically, devaluing some of your hands and promoting others.
The first step is to take a breath and remind yourself this card may be scary for your opponent as well. Then it’s time to reassess what your hand is worth. You need to play the hand you have now, not the hand you had on the previous street.
Play the hand you have now, not the hand you had on a previous street.
If your hand is now toward the bottom of your range, it may well be time to bluff. If it still has showdown value, you can start with a check, though you should remain open to the possibility of turning it into a bluff if your opponent bets.
There’s only so much you can do to salvage the EV of your previously strong hands. They are going to face tough decisions sometimes, no matter what.
What you can do is remember, when you have a monster hand, how easily you could have something more marginal and how worried you would be if you did. You can recall how you’d need to check or block bet those hands, and how much you’d hate it if you faced a big bet or raise after doing so. Then you can consider taking that same line as a trap with your monster.
What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant
 What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant 

Just how costly is it to play a Chip EV style when ICM is significant? We always knew it was a mistake, but we now have an answer thanks to this recent article from Tombos21. He started his search by mapping out the stages of a tournament. Via the data of single-raised and 3-bet pots, it’s possible to empirically demonstrate the average $EV loss of sticking to a Chip EV strategy.
It turns out that doing this can cost you as much as 30% of your buy-in in EV. It’s likely much more though, as only flop strategy was included in the experiment. Again, I implore you to read the article for more detail.
A Flourish chart
This was across 225 flops for both single-raised pots and 3-bet pots. I thought it would be fun and instructive to piggyback on the work Tombos21 had already done by going into depth in a couple of specific hands and replicating the experiment. This means nodelocking a player to follow the Chip EV strategy in an ICM hand and then observing how they get exploited by their opponent.
Preflop Ranges: Chip EV vs ICM
The first consideration is preflop. For a given spot, the ICM range will not be the same as the equivalent Chip EV range because ICM aims to maximize money ($EV) while Chip EV maximizes chips (cEV). This leaves us with a quandary regarding our experiment setup.
            * Should we use the ICM range and the Chip EV range? And then compare them? This would give us a more realistic overview of how both spots would play, but it means there will be hands doing interesting things in one range that are not even in the other range.
            * Or should we use the same range twice? Even though it will not be appropriate for one situation? This does mean we can get the best idea of the broad strategic adjustments that ICM presents.
I say, let’s do both!
Preflop Range Comparisons
First, let’s see what happens when we simply use a Chip EV range when we should use an ICM range, but let the solver play as well as it can postflop afterward.
This is the 30bb Chip EV range for UTG:

Symmetrical stacks: 30bb UTG open in Chip EV (↑) and ICM (bubble) (↓)
And this is the 30bb ICM range for UTG near the bubble:

As you can see, it is slightly tighter (by 1.4%). The shape is also subtly different; we play fewer pocket pairs and medium suited connectors but more Ace-x hands for their blocker value.
In response to the open, this is what the BB does in Chip EV world:

And this is what they do near the bubble:

In a strong ICM environment, there is much more folding by offsuit hands and less raising (despite the allowed raise size being smaller). The bluffs come from suited Ace and King-x hands due to their blocker value and the chance to make a flush. Compare this with a Chip EV setting, where bluffs are picked more from the trashy offsuit portion of the range. Overall, the bluffing range is more polar in ICM. Perhaps the biggest difference is in the way very strong hands like QQ are played: more passively when ICM is a factor, whereas we are raising regularly with TT+ when just playing for chips.
→ To summarize, UTG’s range is almost identical both times, but the BB has relatively more drastic differences between both scenarios.
Postflop Sneak Peek
How significant a mistake would it be for the BB to stick to a Chip EV range on the bubble?
Let’s look at a simple hand example to find out. The BB defends via call and the flop is 9♥8♥2♦.
In both instances, the BB checks 100% of the time.
This is what UTG does when both preflop ranges are the ICM ranges:

UTG c-bet flop strategy vs preflop ICM BB
There is a mix of actions, and the bets lean towards the larger size, as this is a classic polarized range for UTG.
Now, let’s see what UTG does when checked to by the BB who’s wrongly using a Chip EV range:
 What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant 

 What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant 

UTG c-bet flop strategy vs preflop Chip EV BB
It has almost become a range-bet. The large sizings are still favored, but there is also a small-betting range. In this instance, UTG can attack the BB so much because their range is much weaker due to it containing more trash (that has been let through by the wider preflop defense). In ICM world, the BB flats with QQ–99 at full frequency, but these hands mostly raise preflop in Chip EV world. This makes it easy for UTG to attack the BB, because they are not worried about overpairs.
            * When both players have ICM ranges – UTG makes 3.2bb on average at the start of the hand and the BB 1.95bb.
            * When we assign the BB a Chip EV range – UTG makes 3.71bb on average and the BB 1.43bb.
We haven’t even nodelocked yet; we have simply put the wrong range into the solver and allowed both players to play perfectly on the flop, but the BB still incurred a significant cost.
The losses from not accounting for ICM already start ticking up during the preflop phase.
Postflop Strategy: Chip EV vs ICM
Now, let’s compare apples to apples and give both players the ‘correct’ (ICM-adjusted) ranges preflop but not the correct postflop strategy. What we need to do now is give both players the same type of range but run the sim twice, once in the Chip EV model and once in the ICM model. After that, we nodelock the ICM simulation so that one player follows the strategy from the Chip EV sim.
We find ourselves in the following situation: 30bb effective, the CO has opened, the BB has called, and the flop is 932r.
 What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant 

I will study an ICM bubble scenario, so I’ll use the same ranges each time. In this case, 30bb symmetric near the bubble.
1. Chip EV Simulation
To kick things off, let’s look at the Chip EV spot. In all the next examples, the BB checks 100% of the time. This is the CO’s c-bet flop strategy for chips:

A mixed strategy with checking, medium-sized betting, and small betting each ⅓ of the time.
The primary bet size is 33% pot, and this is how the BB responds to it:

2. ICM (Near Bubble) Simulation
Up next is the CO c-bet flop strategy on the bubble of a 200-runner tournament. Both stacks have 30bb, which is also the tournament average on the bubble:

CO c-bet flop strategy vs BB: ICM (near bubble)
It’s worth pausing just to look at the effect of ICM on the strategy. The two classic adjustments are:
            * Bet sizings go down – A mixed strategy has become an almost exclusively 20% pot range-bet strategy.
            * The c-bettor is more aggressive in terms of frequency – They bet 91% of the time instead of 65% of the time.
We can see why when we look at the BB response to the 33% bet. (We can no longer make a perfect comparison as 33% was the primary bet size in Chip EV and 20% is the primary bet size now, but 33% is still used some of the time):
 What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant 

 What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant 

BB response vs CO’s 33% pot flop c-bet: ICM (near bubble)
The BB has to play more cautiously on the bubble. They raise around 17% of the time here, compared to 24% of the time in Chip EV world. The CO bets small more often because they are less concerned about being raised. The underlying reason is that hands require more equity to put chips in the pot, resulting in less hands making the cut.
3. Nodelock Chip EV Strategy in ICM Simulation
Let’s now look at what happens when we mimic a Chip EV strategy on the bubble using nodelocking. If you want to do this yourself, I have done it the ‘easy’ way by inputting the Chip EV frequencies for each action rather than adjusting every single hand for the perfect frequencies. As you can see, the solver came very close to mirroring the Chip EV strategy perfectly. The frequencies are probably what matters the most anyway in this experiment, given we almost range-bet in ICM world and we mix everything in Chip EV world.

Nodelock CO in the ICM simulation to play Chip EV strategy
Now, when we make that 33% pot bet, this is how the BB responds (we have not changed the BB strategy to Chip EV):

 What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant 

BB response vs CO’s (nodelocked: Chip EV) 33% pot flop c-bet: ICM (near bubble)
The BB folds more often, 40% of the time, compared to 37% of the time when they faced the correct ICM strategy. They do raise more often, however.
This is not where the biggest error is being made. Let’s look at what happens when the CO goes for that 84% pot bet, which is never used in the correct ICM strategy. Let’s first look at the Chip EV response from the BB to that bet:
 What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant 

 What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant 

BB response vs CO’s 84% pot c-bet: Chip EV
And this is the response to that same bet but on the bubble:
 What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant 

 What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant 

BB response vs CO’s (nodelocked: Chip EV) 84% pot c-bet: ICM (near bubble)
The BB folds less often, ~45% of the time compared to ~56% in Chip EV world. They also raise less often, more than 13% of the time, compared to ~15% in Chip EV world.
This is the response to the check/raise in Chip EV world:

CO response vs BB’s 33% pot check/raise (vs CO’s 84% pot c-bet): Chip EV
And this is the response on the bubble:

CO response vs BB’s 33% pot check/raise: ICM (near bubble)
The CO folds more and raises less. They are forced to play their range more conservatively. Remember, this is the solver adjusting the best way it can after making an initial mistake. A real-life opponent is less likely to see the error of their ways.
For fun, let’s drive it further and see what happens if the CO adopts the same Chip EV strategy when facing the check/raise by nodelocking the same frequencies. Let’s look at how the BB acts on the previous node, facing the 84% pot c-bet:
 What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant 

 What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant 

BB response vs CO’s (nodelocked: Chip EV) 84% c-bet & response vs x/r: ICM (near bubble)
They fold a little more and raise much less. They raised 14% of the time in the last example but now only 10%. Another big difference is the shape of the range; it is very polarized now. All the best hands raise and a few trashy bluffs (that have some blocker and/or backdoor value). But in the previous example, there were similar value hands that called, and some of the middle-strength hands raised.
The BB has tournament survival to concern themselves with too, so they can no longer raise as wide if their opponent does not respect ICM. However, they do get to play all their best hands precisely how they want without having to look after the middle of their range too much.

Note: In the last example, the missing 0.02bb went to the rest of the field.
Summary
We talk about nits and calling stations when it comes to exploitative strategy, but this might actually be the most common leak in poker: Playing Chip EV when ICM is significant. People who blindly follow Chip EV strategy and ignore ICM are common (I know from experience, having written several books on ICM, the hardest part was convincing people they were necessary). This is especially true of preflop, where some players follow the same charts at every stage of the tournament without further thought.
In the cases we studied, this was the most significant discovery:
The bigger error was using a Chip EV preflop range in an ICM spot even though postflop play was optimal, rather than playing the Chip EV strategy postflop.
This makes sense if you consider the compounding effect of a preflop mistake, which carries over to most subsequent streets.
Do note that we have only touched on the flop here, and as Tombos21 suggested in the article that inspired this one, the cost of this leak on the turn and river is likely even more severe!

The new postflop ICM feature from GTO Wizard is a game changer. Previous incarnations of postflop ICM solvers have been challenging to use and are slow. When you factor in that GTO Wizard also allows bounty calculations and nodelocking with this feature, it might be one of the biggest strategic steps forward in poker technology for quite some time.
As somebody who has previously analyzed postflop ICM spots the ‘old’ way, here are some pitfalls to avoid when using this powerful new feature.
Not Comparing ICM to Chip EV
Just like how GTO is a baseline for you to understand exploits, Chip EV is a baseline to help you understand ICM. The first error you could make when studying postflop ICM is to not compare the outputs to the corresponding Chip EV situation. You develop a much more holistic understanding of ICM when you know what the strategy is deviating from.
Chip EV
For example, this is 30bb effective, BB vs UTG single-raised pot, and the flop is 976r, in Chip EV world. We are using dynamic bet sizing in GTO Wizard AI for all these examples. The first action is from the BB:

After their check, this is the UTG response:

ICM (Money Bubble)
Now, let’s look at the same spot, same stacks, with the only difference being that we are on the bubble with 151 remaining in a 1,000-runner MTT (with 150 paid). The BB’s first action:
 Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes

BB first-in flop (ICM bubble) strategy vs UTG on 976r
As you can see, the BB has developed a donking strategy with 8% of its range. When they do check, this is what happens:

UTG c-bet flop (ICM bubble) strategy vs BB on 976r
UTG bets (~12%) less often in this example and the bet sizing has come down a little. They bet their sets proportionally much more often now and check back AA all the time.
When UTG does bet, this is what the BB does in Chip EV world:

This is what happens in the ICM example:

BB (ICM bubble) response vs UTG’s 65% pot c-bet
There is more folding in ICM world and no raising all-in, but in Chip EV world, the BB is happy to go all-in ~4% of the time.
The strategy is significantly different when ICM is a factor, and this is with equal stack sizes. It would be even more pronounced if the effective stacks were 30bb, but one of the players covered the other significantly.
By just studying the ICM sim and ignoring the Chip EV one, we only learn half the story.
We would know the ‘correct’ way to play this specific spot, but we would not learn about the many ways in which ICM more broadly changes our strategy. By comparing the two, we might make the following assumptions about postflop ICM:
            * Bet sizings come down
            * Covered players are tighter
            * You can lead more in some situations
            * All-in is often less appealing of an option
            * Some hand classes play differently
Note that these are all relative statements (e.g., tighter, lead more, …). All of them are trends you will often see in postflop ICM, and the only way to discover them is by contrasting the ICM strategy with its Chip EV equivalent.
 Responding to BB Squeezes 

One quick note regarding the preflop ranges when comparing Chip EV to ICM: an ICM range for a spot will not be the same as its Chip EV counterpart. Generally speaking, ICM ranges will be wider for chip leaders and tighter for mid and short stacks.
This leaves us with a dilemma when setting up the postflop simulation:
            * Should we input the different but ‘correct’ ranges for each environment, and then compare them?
This would give us a more realistic overview of how both spots would play, but it also means there will be hands doing interesting things in one range that are not even in the other range. So, realistic but harder to compare.
            * Or should we use the same range twice, even though it will not be appropriate for one situation?
This does mean we can get the best idea of the broad strategic postflop adjustments that ICM presents.
I don’t think there is a perfect answer (I did both in this article). The important thing is to be aware that neither approach is perfect and frame your takeaways in that context.
Assuming All Pay Jumps Are the Same
Until very recently, a large cohort of players ignored ICM until they were on the literal money bubble, at which point they would fold almost everything. Once the bubble burst, they would resume ignoring ICM. Few players do this now, but there is still a danger of treating one type of ICM pressure the same as any other.
The bubble of a PKO is different from that of a regular MTT, which is different from that of a satellite. The final table bubble is different from the money bubble. A final table with six left differs from a final table with seven left. A tournament with 100 runners is different from a tournament with 1,000 runners, and so on. If you keep using a default payout structure in a cookie-cutter fashion, you are going to miss out on some valuable lessons.
Let’s look at an example to demonstrate. We will be using the same BB vs BTN single-raised spot every time. They both have 40bb. We’ll keep the ranges the same even when the payout structure changes for ease of comparison. 151 players remain, 150 get paid, and the average stack is 40bb. The field totaled 1,000 runners.
The flop is T52r.
The BB checks 100% of the time, and this is the BTN response:
 Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes 

 Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes 

BTN c-bet flop (ICM bubble of 1,000-runner MTT) strategy vs BB on T52r: 40bb effective
Now, what if we look at the exact same spot, but this time there were only 200 runners in total? The money bubble now reaches maturity when 31 players remain. The average stack size is 40bb again. The BB checks 100% again and this is the BTN response:
 Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes 

 Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes 

BTN c-bet flop (ICM bubble of 200-runner MTT) strategy vs BB on T52r
As you can see, there is less betting on the 200-runner bubble than the 1000-runner bubble. This is because on the 1000-runner bubble, the min-cash is much more important, and as such, we can exert more ICM pressure on the BB. We can’t push our opponent around as much in the 200-runner tournament because they are closer to the top prizes and, therefore, a little more incentivized to play for the win.
Let’s add another twist to this same spot with 200 runners, of which 31 remain, averaging 40bb. The only change is the setting being a satellite with all prizes of equal value. The BB checks 100% of the time and this is … not what I expected. Below is BB’s first-in flop strategy:
 Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes 

 Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes 

BB first-in flop (ICM bubble 200-runner satellite) strategy vs UTG on T52r
The BB shoves 100% of the time rather than checks 100% of the time. Treating a satellite bubble like an MTT bubble is mistaking night for day. The bubble in satellites are all-or-nothing. In this example, a rational BTN who’s aware of the payout implications would even fold a set of Tens here, because there is no upside in accumulating more chips when you have a seat virtually locked up.
If we nodelocked so that the BB checked 100% of the time, this is how the BTN responds:

BTN c-bet flop (ICM bubble 200-runner satellite) strategy vs BB on T52r
They also shove range. Clearly, not all bubbles are the same.
I could go on, but I think I have made my point. ICM is influenced by the stage of the tournament, field size, and the payout structure.
While most MTT structures are roughly similar, minor changes can have an outsized impact on strategy.
The WSOP Main Event, for example, tends to be a little more top-heavy than other WSOP events as the operators try to make for a marketable first prize. This has often influenced the strategy, and using a generic Sunday Million payout structure for the Main Event could lead to a big error.
While it’s important to correctly assess these aspects that influence the formation of bubble factors, in the end, if the bubble factors are the same, the strategies will be too. In theory, if two players have the same bubble factors on the bubble of the Super High Roller Bowl or with 10 left before the money in a two-seat satellite to win a $50 ticket, the strategy should be identical.
Not Being Accurate With the Stacks Outside of the Hand
In addition to the above factors, it’s also important to correctly consider the other inactive stacks remaining in the tournament. Where possible, input every stack size manually.
 Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes 

Setup ICM hand: tournament stage info (stack distribution = manual)
Most of the time, you will use the Automatic Stack Distribution feature, where you input:
               * The remaining players
               * The average stack
               * It also allows us to tinker with the stack distribution.
This greatly boosts your quality of life compared to inputting every stack. For the most part, it won’t make a great deal of difference to the output as long as you get the averages right in large-field MTTs. However, as fields get smaller, the other stack sizes really matter.
Final (two) table(s) is perhaps the tournament stage that you want to be as accurate as possible with these inputs because an extreme outlier stack can have a sizeable impact on the strategy with fewer players and significant ICM pressure. A super short stack on another table during the FT-bubble, for example, where folding would guarantee you a ladder.
 Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes 

Please be aware, however, whenever you change the stacks of the two postflop players, it automatically changes the average stack size.
I discovered this the hard way when I was running the same spot over and over but kept making the OOP player a bigger and bigger stack.
You can see for yourself, if I double the BB’s stack above (from 120bb to 240bb) …
 Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes 

… the average stack goes from 30bb to 135bb, because you have introduced more chips to the tournament, rather than taking them from the stacks on the other table. This can have a significant impact on the strategy. So, if you are going to use the automatic stack distribution feature, input the average stack size every single time you run a hand.
Make sure you also spread the stacks out in a ‘realistic’ manner rather than making them all equal (unless it is a hand at the start of a tournament or a shootout-type format).
 Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes 

Note – All stacks remaining have the same size (= avg. stack of 135bb)
When we don’t vary the spread of stacks on a bubble of a J♦T♦2♠ flop, this is the BB’s first action from the examples above:

 Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes 

 Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes 

BB first-in flop strategy when stack distribution = non-uniform
I’ll not get into the weeds with this one, but as you can see, it is a significant change in strategy. ICM is always impacted by your relative position in the tournament. The more short stacks there are, the more likely it is that everyone else can move up the pay ranks. If there are a lot of big stacks, everyone else might need to make a move to stay in the game. That’s an oversimplified way of looking at it, but it’s just to make the point that the other stacks in the tournament really matter.
Not Nodelocking
For most players, GTO Wizard’s new postflop ICM feature set will be their gateway into getting exposure to strategies like the one laid out above. Some of the insights may shake up their view on poker so much that they won’t even delve into the fact they can nodelock too. This might be the most exciting because the least explored area of poker: “How to play in tough ICM spots when your opponent is making clear mistakes?”
I would suggest that the biggest mistake you can make, in the long term, is not making the most of the opportunities this breakthrough creates because few people are.
Again, let’s jump into an example to help drive the point home. I have often heard people say that: “When a calling station is on the bubble of a tournament, you should play like a nit against them, to avoid leveling yourself and busting out.“
Is this true?
Let’s inspect an example of this scenario. This is a bubble spot where the BTN opened off a 32bb stack, the SB sitting on 28bb responded by 3-betting, and the BTN has called. The flop is A72r. This is the SB’s first action:
 Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes 

 Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes 

SB c-bet flop strategy vs GTO BTN on A72r: 3-bet pot, 28bb effective stacks
It’s very tight, with only betting ~11% of the time. We are covered, out of position, and one place away from the money. When we do bet, this is how the BTN responds:
 Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes 

 Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes 

BTN’s equilibrium response vs SB’s 66% pot c-bet
The BTN folds ~52% of the time and calls ~45% of the time.
What if we made them a calling station, a BTN who never folds flop?
This is what the SB should do:
 Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes 

 Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes 

SB c-bet flop strategy vs never-fold BTN on A72r
Despite being covered, we bet more than half the time, which is five times more than in the GTO example. They even bet with hands like KK–JJ, which would seem like a mistake against a calling station on an Ace-high flop.
This seems common sense, but it goes against the conventional nitty wisdom some players swear by in these spots.
This is just one super simple example, the fun part is exploring these spots further. If you caught the bug, I implore you to look at satellite bubble spots and play around with the calling ranges. You will see some utterly crazy things with just a slight deviation from GTO.
Conclusion
ICM is influenced by:
               * Stack sizes
               * Payout structure
               * The number of entrants
               * Stage of the tournament
To get the most out of GTO Wizard’s postflop ICM engine, you need to understand the significance of these factors.
The main consideration with stack size is that it frames where everybody finds themselves in the tournament relative to the other runners. Having the biggest or shortest stack is significant in endgame tournament spots. Likewise, the presence of large or small stacks not involved in the current hand influences the action. Which player covers the other in a heads-up pot is perhaps the most significant consideration.
What matters in regard to the payout structure essentially boils down to how top-heavy or flat it is. The flatter the payout structure, the tighter play tends to be because the pay jumps are more significant. Conversely, a top-heavy structure incentivizes to ‘play for the win.’
Field size is important because the larger the field, the further away any one player’s prospects of winning it are. Distance from the big payouts on the final table heavily influences strategy.
Most players understand that the stage of the tournament is significant when dealing with the stone bubble, but ICM pressure becomes significant in postflop pots when around half the field has been eliminated. It is an ever-pressing concern thereafter (until heads-up where there is no ICM).
In summary, I would suggest to consider these three elements in your studies:
               * Think of all these ICM factors whenever analyzing a postflop hand.
               * Compare to Chip EV as a baseline every time to understand the broader takeaways of ICM.
Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble
 Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble 

Open-raising on the bubble into players who cover you is scary. Savvy opponents will recognize how dangerous it is for you to play a big pot on the bubble and look for opportunities to pressure you both before and after the flop.
Yet, there are hands strong enough to warrant contesting a pot on the bubble against covering players. Doing so profitably requires walking a fine line between getting value, protecting equity, and protecting what remains of your stack. Above all, it requires an awareness of your own range and the ability to leverage the strength of your opening range to help you win the pot even when your current hand is not strong.
This article will examine an SRP near the bubble between a somewhat short-stacked BTN and a covering BB. We will look at how preflop incentives shape postflop play, which should follow radically different patterns depending on the characteristics of the flop. While the exact ranges and strategies discussed here will be specific to these parameters (stack sizes, positions, tournament field size), the general principles will apply to other scenarios where the preflop raiser has a much higher risk premium than a caller from the blinds.
Preflop Considerations
Making sense of postflop play in this scenario requires understanding the preflop incentives that nudge the players to see the flop with very different ranges. Earlier in the tournament, BTN and BB ranges are somewhat similar in an SRP, with both players incentivized to play many quite modest hands. But in this bubble case, a short-stacked BTN in particular should have a much stronger range.
Consider the predicament: it folds to you on the BTN, with just two players remaining to act behind. You would love to steal the blinds and antes, which would increase your stack by more than 10%. But risking elimination so close to the bubble is an expensive proposition; few hands will be strong enough to stand up to the pressure that can be generated by the covering stacks in the blinds.
 How ICM Impacts Restealing From The Blinds 

Does that mean you should only open with hands that can stand up to that pressure?
That could be a good adjustment against over-aggressive blinds, but there are two fundamental problems with this overly conservative strategy:
               * Precisely because opening on the bubble is so risky, your opponents should expect you to be strong when you do it, which reduces their incentive to pressure you.
               * You will often end up playing postflop, usually against a BB caller. You’d prefer to minimize your opponent’s ability to predict which boards you will or will not be strong on (because that could result in pressure as well).
If your opening range is too wide, you’ll be vulnerable to 3-bets and other sorts of pressure from covering players. But if it is too tight, you may miss out on profitable steals.
Just as in any other situation in poker, your default should be a balanced range unless you have an intentionally crafted exploitative strategy based on reads on the players behind you. Of course, you’ll need a much better hand than usual to continue to a 3-bet, so your value range will be smaller, and that will necessitate a tighter range of “light” opens as well. But you should be capable of opening both.
A helpful way of conceptualizing this is that folding in a tournament always has EV greater than $0 because your stack gains value whenever other players are eliminated, even if they are not at your table. On the bubble, the BTN’s value of folding is much greater than $0 because it will practically guarantee a min-cash. Raising can still be correct, but the EV of doing so must be greater than the EV of folding, and that’s a high bar.
 Flop Heuristics: OOP C-Betting in MTTs 

The ideal candidates for the bottom of your opening range block your opponents’ 3-betting ranges and retain good equity when called. That means even your raise/folds should be mostly big, ideally suited cards.
In the example we’ll be considering, the BTN is opening off an 18bb stack into an SB with 41bb and a BB with 26bb. The average stack is 35bb, very close to the bubble of a 1000-runner tournament.
 Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble 

None of these players want to lose a big pot, but it is far worse for BTN, who risks elimination and the loss of the minimum prize they could almost certainly secure by folding. As a result, BTN has a bubble factor of 1.98, while BB’s bubble factor against BTN is 1.3 and SB’s is just 1.1:
 Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble 

Bubble factors: near bubble of 1,000-player MTT
BTN opens 17% of hands and jams another 2%, totaling 19%. This is a far cry from the ~50% opening frequency we should expect earlier in the tournament. Their raising range is heavy on Ace-x and King-x, and less studied players who never shove will be heavier still, with quite a few more offsuit Ace-x combinations in their range:
 Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble 

BTN opening strategy: ICM (near bubble)
Despite the strength of BTN’s opening range and some ICM pressure of their own, BB calls a much wider and more diverse range, folding only small, disconnected, offsuit hands:
 Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble 

BB response vs BTN’s min-open: ICM (near bubble)
BB is getting great odds to call and, as the covering stack, can anticipate some advantages when playing postflop. BTN should be playing cautiously, resulting in BB getting more free cards and cheap showdowns when they want them. BB can also use BTN’s somewhat predictable range and the threat of the bubble to get some efficient bluffs and equity denial.
With BTN tightening up dramatically and BB somewhat less so, relative to comparable spots earlier in the tournament, we should expect to see a significant equity advantage for BTN on most flops. However, their emphasis on Ace-x and King-x hands in their raising range also means that while flops with big cards will be especially good for them, they will be more vulnerable on low card flops, especially those where BB can flop straights. They must play defensively on these flops, as BB should attempt to use their nuts advantage to apply pressure on these disadvantageous (for BTN) flops.
We will examine BTN’s strategy heads-up against a BB caller on four flops:
               * A62tt – an Ace-high flop with low cards
               * AQ2r – an Ace-high flop with a second Broadway card
               * 853tt – a low, disconnected flop
               * 854tt – a low, connected flop
Ace-Low-Low
BTN enjoys an enormous range advantage on A♠6♦2♦, with 68.5% equity to BB’s 31.5% and a nuts advantage to boot.
 Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble 

Equity distribution BB vs BTN on A62tt: ICM near bubble
This follows straightforwardly from the preflop ranges we have discussed already. BTN’s range is heavy on Ace-x, while BB’s is diluted by many hands that miss this flop. Even the non-Ace cards (6 and 2) do not connect well with BB’s range because they mostly fold their small offsuit cards preflop.
Thus, BB will struggle to defend their equity to even a small bet, and BTN basically min-bets their entire range when checked to:

BTN’s response to a half-pot raise—BB’s most commonly used raise size—is also simple. There are a few cases where they call with a backdoor draw or fold a small pair without one, but mostly, they call if they have a pair or a flush draw and fold if they don’t.
If you must play a pot on the bubble against a covering stack, you want easy decisions, so this is about as good as it gets. BTN’s turn-barreling strategy is designed to offer easy decisions as well, which is to say, on a neutral turn like the 8♥, it’s a big, polar bet with a strong Ace or better for value and unpaired trash for the bluffs:

That means BTN is not barreling draws here, unless they also have top pair:

Even blocking big diamonds is undesirable because flush draws will make up much of BB’s folding range on the turn:

It’s usually not so easy to push opponents off 9-out draws, but in this case, because of the general strength of BTN’s range on this board and the fact that BB is also under some ICM pressure makes it feasible.
If you must play a pot on the bubble against a covering stack, you want easy decisions.
Ace-Broadway-Low
As good as the A62 flop was for BTN, A♠Q♥2♦ is better still. BTN has more than 74% of the equity and captures 85% of the EV! Yet, they continuation bet considerably less often on this flop:

This is because more than half of BB’s range flops less than 20% equity!

Equity distribution BB vs BTN on AQ2r: ICM near bubble
BTN almost always pairs up on this flop, and when they don’t, they often have a gutshot and two live cards (in fact, they are somewhat often ahead even when they miss). The bottom of BB’s range, hands like 75o, are drawing nearly dead against BTN’s pairs.
When BTN flops a medium-strength hand that they don’t want to play a large pot with (e.g., QJ, A♣5♣, or JJ), they have little incentive to bet. Some of these hands, like JJ, perform poorly against BB’s calling range. Others, like A5, will be strong enough to bet later if BB keeps checking but aren’t looking to play for stacks, so sacrifice little by checking. They don’t care about pushing the bottom of BB’s range off its equity, nor are they looking to grow a pot against the top of that range. Betting these hands would not lose money, but it would mostly result in taking down pots BTN would have won anyway by checking.
BTN has a few traps at the very top end of their range, where they block much of what would call multiple bets. But they don’t slow-play often, because the rest of their checking range is strong enough that BB won’t be terribly tempted to bluff into it. BTN never checks their worst hands, however; when they check, it’s with stuff like J♥T♥ and 66, which retains some equity it would have lost by betting, especially if raised.

Manhattan plot of BTN’s flop strategy
These hands, even the small pairs, won’t check all the way to showdown unimproved. After BTN checks the flop, they will be the new bottom of the range and will eventually bluff if BB keeps checking.
Once again, we see a polar strategy that largely avoids tough decisions by checking the hands that don’t want to get raised or play for large pots.
Low Disconnected
8♦5♥3♥ is one of those flops that is obviously bad for BTN’s Broadway-heavy range. But it isn’t as bad as you might expect—BTN retains more than 55% of the equity and realizes about that much of the EV as well—but it isn’t nearly as good as the Ace-high boards we’ve investigated so far.
A lot of BTN’s equity is locked up in unpaired hands, which will face tough decisions on many runouts and would prefer not to grow the pot. If BB was forced to check, BTN would c-bet only about 12% of the time. By comparison, facing a forced check at an earlier stage of the tournament, BTN c-bets 63% of the time on this flop.
BB, not wanting to give BTN this comfortable option, has a lot of incentive not to check. At equilibrium, they donk-bet roughly half their range for 20% pot.
BTN’s response is simpler than you might think; they mostly call (folding only their most hopeless hands) and jam a narrow range heavy on strong but vulnerable pairs. Note that there are no flush draws in this jamming range!

Even on the bubble, you can peel pretty wide, getting 6:1 odds (before factoring in risk premium) in position. Remember that this calling range is quite strong, featuring sets, big pairs, and strong draws. It will not be trivial for BB to keep barreling turns, so BTN often gets to see two cards for this low price.
Facing a check, BTN actually shoves some of the same hands and bets a narrow range with more pairs and some draws and backdoor draws.
 Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble 

BTN c-bet flop strategy vs BB on 853tt: ICM near bubble
Keep in mind that this is an equilibrium strategy that factored in BB’s incentive to donk-bet many of their strongest hands. If you believe your human opponent would not have a donking range, you can exploit that by betting less often.
Playing later streets on this dynamic board will require an awareness of your own range. Your range is heavy on Broadway cards, so on Broadway turns, you can bet more aggressively. If you face bets on those turns, you don’t need to get too stubborn about defending because you’ll have many naturally strong hands. On blank turns, it will be correct to continue with more of your best unpaired hands, especially if the bet is small.
Low Connected
8♦5♥4♥ is a truly bad flop for BTN. They actually still have a slight equity advantage, but BB captures nearly 58% of the EV. They flop enough sets, straights, and two pairs (of these, BTN has only 88) to support a robust bluffing range and deter BTN from raising, especially because they also flop more pairs than BTN. Their equilibrium strategy is to lead their entire range!

BTN’s response is actually pretty similar to the 853tt flop, with few folds and even fewer shoves:

When you’re fortunate enough to face a check, you should be grateful for the free turn and not bet terribly often. This is BTN’s equilibrium c-betting strategy:

Because checking is not really a part of BB’s equilibrium strategy, however, any human player checking to you in this spot is likely doing so exploitably. And the exploit against a player who never donk-bets here is to check back your entire range.
Conclusion
Not all flops encourage such extreme strategies, but by studying the extremes, we can build intuition around how to approach most flops. The King-high flops will play more similarly to the Ace-high ones. The lower flops will play more similarly to 853 or 854, depending on how connected they are. And so on.
At the beginning of this article, I said that, when opening from the BTN, “you’d prefer to minimize your opponent’s ability to predict which boards you will or will not be strong on.” Since then, it seems like we’ve talked about nothing except how some cards are obviously good for BTN and some obviously bad. What gives?
The key word here is “minimize.” Your preflop incentives force you to be somewhat predictable. There’s real value in blocking the blinds’ strongest hands, which you capture by opening mostly hands with an Ace or King in them. The key is to recognize what your opponent can deduce about your range based on this and play around it.
You don’t want to go broke on the bubble, but that doesn’t mean you immediately wave the white flag when you miss the flop. Your opponent, getting a great price and incentivized to bully you, will often miss the flop themselves, and you can leverage the stronger hands in your range to protect the weaker ones.
On Favorable Boards
On boards that strongly favor you, that means betting a polarized range, coupling your strong hands with your weak hands while checking medium-strength hands for delayed value or a cheap showdown. This is why 66 bluffs on AQX, even though it may have some showdown value. You have so few weak hands on this board that it is more profitable to bluff than to showdown a weak pair.
On Not-So-Favorable Boards
On boards that aren’t supportive of your range, it means more calling and checking, even with your strongest hands, so your range is uncapped and dangerous to bet into. This minimizes (but doesn’t eliminate) their ability to use bubble pressure and an unfavorable board against you.
Above all, the main takeaway of this article is the following:
Contesting pots against covering stacks on the bubble, requires accepting that you’ll have to face some uncomfortable spots, make some uncomfortable tradeoffs, and generally under-realize your equity.
You must place a high premium on the last of your chips, and that will sometimes mean foregoing a protection-bet or even folding a hand that could easily be best.
When you raise preflop, you really want the blinds to fold. When they don’t, you’ve got to make the best out of a bad situation. Sometimes the flop bails you out, but you should not expect to win as many pots or get as much value as you would at earlier stages of the tournament. Survival must take precedence!
Slow-Playing
 Slow-Playing 

Slow-playing, like running a big bluff or making a heroic call, feels great when it works. It feels like you are winning by wits alone, playing your opponent like a fiddle as you cajole them into throwing ever more money into a pot they have no chance of winning.
The danger of this good feeling is that it may seduce you into slow-playing when it is not wise to do so, costing you many chips, if not the entire pot. Ultimately, you want to play big pots with your big hands, so it’s best to find ways to create deception while still putting chips into the pot.
In this article, we will consider the incentives around slow-playing:
               * What are the risks?
               * What are the rewards?
               * And when is it just fancy play syndrome?
What Is Slow-playing?
You probably have some idea already, but for the sake of clarity, when I talk about slow-playing, I am talking about:
Deliberately taking a passive line—checking and calling—with a hand strong enough to bet or raise for value.
The purpose of slow-playing is to deceive your opponent into thinking your hand is weaker than it actually is. To keep things simple, I will generally talk about slow-playing the flop, but similar considerations will apply to slow-playing before the flop or on the turn (or on other streets, in other games—the material in this article is not terribly specific to Hold ‘em).
Incentives and Deception
Deception is not an end in itself.
Your ultimate goal when you hold a strong hand is for the pot to grow. Deception is valuable only insofar as it causes your opponent to put more money into the pot than they would have had you played your hand more aggressively.
 Flop Heuristics: OOP C-Betting in MTTs 

For an extreme example, suppose you checked the nuts last to act on the river. That would certainly be deceptive, but it would not accomplish your goal of playing for big pots with big hands. This example may sound ridiculous, but in fact, people make ridiculous, counterproductive slow-playing decisions all the time because they fixate on deceiving their opponent rather than on growing the pot.
 Is Limping Pimping? 

Deception in poker is not necessarily about playing a hand contrary to its incentives. Often, you can be just as deceptive by playing your hand in a way that is perfectly aligned with its incentives but which could also credibly represent a different sort of hand with different incentives.
An Example
Suppose you open the BTN in a 100bb cash game and the BB calls. You bet 125% pot on a K♠9♥5♦ flop and 125% pot again on a 2♣ turn.
Is this a deceptive way to play a set of fives? Why or why not?
From one perspective, it sure looks like you have a strong holding. You’re shoveling money into the pot, with the threat of an all-in bet looming on the river. That’s exactly what you’d like to do with a very strong hand, and your opponent has good reason to fold for fear that you may have one.
But they also have good reason not to fold because, from another perspective, this is also exactly what you’d like to do with some of your weakest holdings. Precisely because this is how you’d like to play a strong hand, it’s a good, deceptive way to play a weak hand. And vice versa. Playing strong and weak hands in this way gives both the opportunity to accomplish their objectives and puts your opponent in a genuinely tough spot.
In other words, it creates deception without compromising the incentives of each hand in the range:
               * To grow the pot, in the case of a strong hand
               * And to steal the pot, in the case of a weak hand
As it happens, the solver takes this line with both strong hands (such as sets) and weak hands (such as gutshots).
What Does Slow-playing Represent?
In my experience as a coach, people tend to be very aware of “telling a story” when they are bluffing. That is, they think about what they are representing and why it is plausible they could have that strong hand instead of the weak one they currently hold. But storytelling is just as important when you have a strong hand! In either case, the aim is to deceive your opponent by credibly representing a hand other than the one you currently have.
When you check the flop, you may be telling the story that you are weak. But as soon as you put chips into the pot after checking, the jig is up. It no longer looks like you have a weak hand because weak hands usually fold after checking.
 Slow-Playing 

Checking and calling looks like either a medium-strength hand or a trap. That’s not necessarily a problem, as representing a middling hand could entice your opponent to run a big bluff, but you should be aware of what you’re representing so your play (storyline) remains coherent on later streets. If, after checking and calling, you come out with a massive bet on the river, that’s not consistent with a medium-strength hand, nor is it the best way to win money from your opponent’s bluffs, which is what you were presumably trying to induce by checking and calling in the first place.
Risk 1: Giving Free Cards
The obvious risk of slow-playing, the one people are most aware of, is the risk of a free card costing you the pot. The less obvious risk is failing to grow the pot, which, as we will see, can cost you quite a lot of potential winnings even when it doesn’t cost you the pot itself.
Most humans tend toward loss aversion, an excessive concern for holding on to what they already have, even if it means missing opportunities to gain more than they would put at risk. It is understandable, then, that the average poker player would worry more about the risk of losing a pot they are currently winning than the risk of missing out on future winnings. Winning a big pot feels good, and your brain may deliver roughly the same dopamine hit for whether you win $500 or $700, whereas it may punish you excessively if your choice to slow-play costs you a pot your brain was already counting as its own.
 Cold Four-Betting 

This is not to say that the risk of giving free cards is negligible, only that it tends to get too much attention in discussions around slow-playing. In particular, people tend to fixate on the wrong ways in which a free card could hurt them.
A free card costs you the pot only if the hand that improved to beat you would have folded to a bet.
Big, obvious, strong draws like flush draws and open-ended straight draws don’t generally fold to bets, so while slow-playing may cost you the opportunity to put money in as a small favorite against those draws, it doesn’t cost you as big of a pot when they draw out.
The scenarios where a free card really costs you dearly are when a hand that would have folded hits an unexpected miracle. If you check 55 on that K♠9♥5♦ and your opponent holding 66 turns a bigger set, you aren’t costing yourself just the current pot but additional bets on the turn and river as well. It’s not a likely scenario, but it’s expensive when it happens.
 What is leverage in poker? 

Risk 2: Failing To Grow the Pot
The other risk of slow-playing is failing to grow the pot, which can result in winning much less when your opponent has a hand that would have put more money into the pot. Suppose you flop a royal flush against a very special opponent. This opponent will sometimes fold to flop bets, but they never fold to pot-sized bets on the turn and river. With $100 in the pot, you have a choice between two betting lines:
               * You can bet 30% pot on the flop, 100% pot on the turn, and 100% pot on the river. Or,
               * You can check the flop, bet 100% pot on the turn, and 100% pot on the river.
How often does your opponent need to fold the flop in option 1 to make it worse than option 2?
It’s easy to calculate what option (2) is worth. Your opponent never folds, so you win a $100 bet on the turn, a $300 bet on the river, and the starting pot of $100, for a total of $500.
When your opponent calls your $30 flop bet in option (1), you then bet $160 on the turn and $480 on the river, plus the starting pot, for a total of $770. Missing out on one small bet might seem like a small price to pay to get two big bets guaranteed on the turn and river, but because that small bet sets you up to make even larger bets on the later streets, you lost out on not just the $30 bet but a total of $270 over the course of the hand. Your opponent would need to fold the flop more than 40% of the time to the 30% pot flop bet to make option 1 less desirable!
But There Are Also Rewards
Real poker is much more complicated, of course, but this simple example demonstrates one common effect of slow-playing:
Checking the flop with a strong hand often makes it more likely you will get two bets, but less likely you will get three.
There are three primary means by which checking might induce your opponent to put in bets on later streets with hands that would not have paid you off otherwise :
               * They had a weak hand on the flop and would’ve folded, but the turn improves them to a second-best hand with which they are willing to pay off bets.
               * Checking induces them to bluff with a weak hand that would have folded to a flop bet.
               * Because you are generally incentivized to bet your strongest hands, they correctly lower their standards for putting money into the pot on future streets after seeing you check the flop.
Timing Your Slow Plays
In light of the above risks and rewards, we can reach some conclusions about when slow-playing may be desirable. Recall the two major risks of slow-playing: getting outdrawn and failing to grow the pot. When neither of these represents a grave concern, slow-playing becomes more desirable.
On that K95r flop we’ve been talking about, very few hands show a strong preference for betting over checking. The few that do include 55 and 99, but not KK. Why do you think that is?
 Slow-Playing 

EV comparison: check vs bet 33% pot
 Slow-Playing 

 Slow-Playing 

 Slow-Playing 

The hands most likely to call you down on three streets have a King in them. So, the cost—in the form of missed out on benefits—of slow-playing KK is less than the cost of slow-playing lower sets because, when you so heavily block the BB’s King-x hands, you are unlikely to get three bets paid off anyway. This is also why a set of Nines has higher EV than a set of Kings.
Another argument for slow-playing is when your hand simply is not strong enough to value-bet three times. In that case, checking doesn’t cost you a bet because you weren’t going to bet three times anyway.
Checking as a slow play doesn’t cost you a bet when that extra bet couldn’t be profitably made.
BTN often slow-plays their weaker Kings on this flop because they are tough to draw out on—only one larger card could fall—and won’t bet three times unless they improve:
 Slow-Playing 

You may not think of this as slow-playing, but that’s essentially what it is, and there’s an important point here:
The best hands for slow-playing are often not your very strongest hands, with which you’d like to be growing the pot, but rather hands that are tough to draw out on but also not so strong they want to grow an enormous pot.
This is especially true when it comes to inducing bluffs, which is one of the three rewards of slow-playing we identified earlier.
Top pair with a bad kicker beats bluffs just as surely as bottom set does, and it gives up a lot less when it checks to induce.
If you have ever seen young children play soccer, you will understand this concept intuitively. Before they understand the concept of (or have the necessary discipline for) playing position, children just swarm the ball, everyone trying to kick it all at once. There is nobody to pass to and nobody playing defense because they are all in a pack around the ball.
Hands in your range are like players on a soccer team: some fit certain roles/positions better than others, and your team will perform best when everyone sticks to their role/plays their position. Very strong hands excel at betting for value, so that is generally the position they should play. Medium-strength hands are better assigned to the bluff-catching position, especially when they are tough to draw out on.
 Slow-Playing 

If you assign all your players to catch bluffs, then you’ve got no one playing offense, a strategy that will perform about as well as those five-year-olds swarming the ball. They’re cute, but it doesn’t take Real Madrid to beat them. Even a team of slightly older children, executing slightly better on the game’s fundamentals (roles), will pick them apart.
Shallow Stacks
There is another case where checking is unlikely to cost you a bet with your strongest hands: when the stacks are so shallow that you don’t need three bets to get all-in. A 20bb sim for the same K95r flop shows a high frequency of slow-playing KK and 99:
 Slow-Playing 

(Even at 40bb, the lower sets sometimes slow-play.)
Note that other strong hands such as AA, AK, KQ, and KJ purely bet. Of course, they don’t require three streets to get stacks in any more than 99 does, but they are more vulnerable to free cards. With the pot being larger relative to the stacks, the reward for slow-playing is reduced, making the risk of getting drawn out on a greater concern for more vulnerable hands.
Another Way To Slow-Play
Although KK and 99 do not really check in the 100bb equilibrium, they do often bet small. This is true despite the fact that BTN often uses larger bet sizes, including with these hands.
Why does a solver expect betting 33% pot with Kings to make just as much as betting 125%?
 Slow-Playing 

This is, in essence, another form of slow-playing.
A hand can be played slower not only by checking instead of betting (or calling instead of raising), but also by betting small instead of betting large.
A small bet, at equilibrium, performs just as well as a large bet because it can induce bluffs (raises, in this case) and light calls, including from hands that would have folded to a larger bet but could improve to something still worse on the turn.
A small bet is at least as consistent with how BTN would play some weak hands as checking is, and it has the added benefit of growing the pot. We have already seen how heavily even a small flop bet can increase your winnings on later streets compared to a check. KK is a good candidate for this play, just as it is for checking, because it blocks so many of the hands that would call a larger bet.
If BB calls this small bet, BTN can start growing the pot more dramatically with an overbet on the turn or continue “slow-playing” with another smallish bet. KK is once again a better candidate than 99 for the slow-playing option because of its blockers.
Conclusion
Understanding the risks and rewards of slow-playing can help you better decide, in real-life game situations, which of these options is suitable with a given hand. As we saw in these examples, the equilibrium EVs often run quite close between checking, betting small, or betting large. But that does not mean they will actually be close against a human opponent!
Will this player check-raise as aggressively as a solver would against a small c-bet? Will they fire big bluffs, possibly even overbets, if you check the flop? Will big bets make them suspicious, such that they call down light?
Setting aside these human factors, there are structural considerations as well. Is a free card more likely to improve your opponent’s weakest holdings to second-best hands or to something stronger than your monster? How large is the pot? How much remains in the stacks? Do you block the hands most likely to play a big pot with you?
That’s a lot to consider, but the better you can manage that, the better your slow-playing decisions will be. But a good rule of thumb for slow-playing is: when in doubt, don’t. You want to play big pots with big hands, and the most straightforward way to do that is simply to bet or raise at every opportunity.
MDF vs ICM: Rethinking Bluffing & Defense Strategies in MTTs
 MDF in ICM 

Minimum Defense Frequency (MDF) is, strictly speaking, the calling (and/or raising) frequency that makes your opponent’s 0% equity hands indifferent between bluffing and giving up. It’s a frequently misapplied concept, because even in Chip EV scenarios, the hands you’re aiming to make indifferent to bluffing not always have 0% equity. And, there are many spots where your opponent is supposed to get profitable bluffs.
Once we throw ICM into the mix, MDF goes out the window.
There are still spots in ICM where you want to make your opponent indifferent to bluffing, but equity is not the best measure of a hand’s value. A central tenet of tournament poker is that chips lost are worth more than chips won, and that complicates the math behind bluffing, bluff-catching, and indifference.
 MDF in ICM 

ICM in the Clairvoyance Game
In the Clairvoyance game, a player holding either the nuts or the nut low when last to act on the river with a pot-sized bet remaining in the stacks maximizes their (Chip) EV, at equilibrium, by always shoving the nuts while bluffing with half as many nut low combos. Because a pot-sized bet offers 2:1 odds on a call, this player makes their opponent indifferent to bluff-catching with a value:bluff ratio of 2:1.
Similarly, the player holding the bluff-catcher maximizes their (Chip) EV, at equilibrium, by calling half the time. Because a bluff would risk one pot to win one pot, a call:fold ratio of 1:1 makes the bettor indifferent to bluffing.
To simulate this game in a solver, we can:
               * Set the ranges of BTN = {AA, QQ} and BB = {KK}
               * On a board of 222 33
(We don’t even need to nodelock BB as a forced check, because they’d have no incentive to bet anyway.)
Here’s a custom sim that recreates the Clairvoyance game, in Chip EV.
Enter ICM
In some alternate universe, we play this hand near the bubble of a 1000-player MTT, with both players having an average stack. Here’s the new betting strategy:
 MDF in ICM 

The bluffing candidates fire ~94% of the time!
 MDF in ICM 

This is a bit counter-intuitive because bluffing is much riskier on the bubble. The 10bb BTN stands to win if the bluff succeeds are not worth nearly as much as their last 10bb, which is what they will lose if the bluff is called. Why do they bluff so much more often then?
Remember, the goal of bluffing (at the right frequency) is to make your opponent indifferent to bluff-catching. So, when you think about bluffing, you have to think about it in relation to bluff-catching. This is the key to understanding the above shift in strategy toward more bluffing. It makes no sense to bluff more given that it’s more risky on the bubble. The thing is that bluff-catching is also much riskier on the bubble.
In fact, between the two, bluff-catching is even more risky here, because the majority of the time it results in elimination from the tournament. Even in this scenario, BTN is value-betting slightly more often than they are bluffing, which means BB will lose more often than they win when they call.
Of course, with the pot-sized bet of 10bb already in the pot, BB wins twice as many chips when they catch bluffs as they lose when they run into value-bets. That’s what motivates BTN to value-bet twice as often as they bluff in the Chip EV version of the game. With ICM in the mix, winning 20bb is nowhere near twice as good as losing your last 10bb is bad, so BTN must bluff more often to make calling at all appealing to the BB.
Unlike BB’s bluff-catches, which frequently (52% of the time) lose, BTN’s bluffs get through more often (65% of the time). BB actually calls less often in this ICM scenario than in Chip EV, even though BTN is much more likely to be bluffing:
 MDF in ICM 

This is because the goal of bluff-catching (at the right frequency) is to make the opponent indifferent to bluffing. Bluffing is very risky for the aggressor, so they must expect to get the bluff through fairly often—more often than in a Chip EV scenario—to risk attempting it.
Bet Sizing
Unlike in Chip EV, ICM spots are not zero-sum between the players involved. A big confrontation is bad for both of them, because someone is going to lose something (the last 10bb of their stack) more valuable than what the other wins (another 10bb added to an already above-average stack).
If the loser loses more than the winner wins, what happens to the rest of that value?
It’s distributed to the other players in the tournament, especially the short stacks who are sweating the bubble. There is some raw intuition around this even amongst unstudied players. A player losing the last of their chips on the bubble of a major tournament is often met with cheers, because it means everyone else has just secured a min-cash.
This is why we see the counterintuitive equilibrium of BB calling less often on the bubble even though BTN bluffs more often. In the game of ICM chicken, a big collision is bad for both players, especially when the last of their chips are involved. The aggressor bluffs more often because they expect their opponent to fold more often. Bluffing often results in them winning a big pot without that disastrous confrontation.
The defender, however, folds more often even when they know the aggressor is bluffing more often. Once the bet is out there, the only way to avoid a collision is to fold. The collision would be so severe that they are incentivized to avoid it even though they would often win a large (but still not worth it) pot by calling.
With that in mind, let’s see what happens when we give the aggressor a choice of bet sizes:
 MDF in ICM 

In a Chip EV context, the player with the polarized range would prefer to bet as large as possible, even if that meant shoving for one million times the pot. As long as they didn’t run out of hands to bluff with—which they couldn’t in this scenario, because their bluffing frequency should never exceed 50% no matter how large they bet—a bigger bet just means more unexploitable bluffing. With a sufficiently large bet size, they essentially capture the entire pot.
When the polarized aggressor’s risk premium is high, they perform best by holding on to the last of their chips.
Winning an extra big blind with their value-bets isn’t nearly as good as losing the last of their chips on a bluff is bad, so they take a slightly more conservative approach in an ICM context, leaving themselves room to hopefully fold into the money even if their bluff fails. Or, if value-betting, they represent that they are hedging against a failed bluff by doing the same.
Note that they are still quite aggressive with the sizing, preferring to bet 80–90% of the remaining stack. Because the last of their chips are the most valuable, those are the only ones they really care about holding onto. The rest they’d rather invest in the bet, as a larger bet facilitates more bluffs and bigger wins when value-bets are called.
To be clear, this is a different phenomenon from other not-quite-all-in bets, which you may see at any stage of the tournament. While there is always some ICM effect in a tournament, the main reason to leave a few chips behind earlier in the tournament is to retain the ability, in the event that you lose the pot, to invest those chips on the next hand getting amazing odds thanks to the blinds and antes. That’s not the effect we’re seeing here, as this sim does not incorporate any future game considerations.
Downward Drift and Thin Value Bets
We’re going to look at one final toy game that illustrates another important principle of ICM, which Dara O’Kearney and Barry Carter call “downward drift.” This game is similar to the Clairvoyance game, with two important differences:
               * BTN has a range consisting of all pairs 44–AA.  {44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, TT, JJ, QQ, KK, AA}
BB has a range consisting of all pairs 77–QQ.                         {77, 88, 99, TT, JJ, QQ}
So, BTN still has the more polar range, but there is now some overlap in the middle.
               * BB is not allowed to raise. They are forced to check and then, regardless of the bet size they face, may only call or fold.
Here is BTN’s Chip EV strategy for this game when they are permitted a variety of bet sizes:

With QQ+, they shove. These hands are all unbeatable, though QQ will sometimes chop, as it is also in the defender’s range.
The 50% bet is for JJ. Though Jacks could profitably shove, the smaller bet size incentivizes BB to call with a wider range against which Jacks are a bigger favorite. Stronger hands never mix with this smaller bet size because the defender is not allowed to raise.
77–TT have too much equity to bluff but are not strong enough to value-bet (not for the bet sizes allowed in this sim, anyway).
Bluffs come from any combination of 44–66. These hands are all equally worthless and have no interaction with the defender’s range, so while the bluffing frequency is important, it doesn’t matter which combos are used for which bet size.
Inject ICM
Now, here’s the same game played on the bubble of a 1000-player tournament:

Even the nuts play better as a 90% pot-sized bet than a shove (100% pot), just as we saw in the ICM Clairvoyance game.
Unlike in the Chip EV sim, QQ prefers a smaller bet of 70% pot. The defender’s reduced incentive to catch bluffs means that Queens chops more often against the hands that call a shove. 70% pot still gets big value while incentivizing more calls from worse.
JJ also downsizes, betting 30% rather than 50% pot for the same reason.
Bluffs still slot equally well into any of the bet sizes. The overall bluffing frequency is higher because, just as we saw in the original clairvoyance game, this is necessary to make BB indifferent to bluff-catching on the bubble.
Bluff-catching gets increasingly undesirable as the bet size gets larger.
This is why the difference between BTN’s bluffing frequency on the bubble and in Chip EV grows disproportionately with bet size as well.
Conclusion
ICM changes incentives around bluffing and bluff-catching, which changes optimal bluffing and bluff-catching frequencies. Intuition derived from MDF and Chip EV simulations will be an unreliable guide, when risk premiums are high! Instead, adjust by considering the following heuristics:
                  * In tournaments, losing chips is worse than winning chips is good. The upside is smaller than the downside. This creates a risk premium.
                  * Risk premium worsens the (ICM-adjusted) pot odds, disincentivizing calls. Put simply, bluff-catching is less attractive. As the aggressor, you should theoretically bluff more often or use smaller bet sizes to make your opponent indifferent between calling and folding.
                  * Risk premium, however, also lowers the reward of bluffing. This means you should fold more often to keep your opponents indifferent to bluffing, especially when the bluff risks the last of their chips.
                  * Tournaments incentivize everyone to be risk-averse. However, bluff-catching is inherently riskier than bluffing. That’s because when you bluff-catch you are guaranteed to collide, whereas bluffing only sometimes results in a collision.
                  * The last of your chips is the most valuable. When you are very close to the bubble or another pay jump, holding on to just a single big blind could enable you to secure a (bigger) prize. When betting the river, consider betting slightly less than all-in. You’ll win less with your value-bets, but you’ll avoid losing the last of your chips on a bluff (or if your value-bet gets called by better), and that’s more important.
