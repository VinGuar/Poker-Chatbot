Pics back this up.\n-IP ev increases a lot when deep stack, huge thing to know\n\n\n \nHow To Play Overpairs\n \nSRPs as the Preflop Aggressor\n \nI want to start off by looking at the boards where we bet at an extremely high frequency (J72r etc), and then at a relatively high frequency (K65, J42 etc), before moving on to some of the lower/more connected boards (852, 653 etc) where our global frequency will be much lower.\n \nJ72r BTN vs BB \u2013 if we take a look at these boards which are very high frequency cbets (75% and above), we'll see that our KK/QQ are betting always, and then our aces are betting at a very high frequency, but finding a sliver of checks. Our KK/QQ want to bet always, not for protection, but because there is even more value to be had. If we force a cbet on J72, we can see that there are a lot of one pair hands that can call, but so many ace highs in the big blind's range as well. This proves that when we bet KK, it's not so much for protection from the turned overcards, but to get immediate value on the flop from a lot of ace high combos. When we have pocket aces ourselves, we of course block those A highs that will call. That's one small reason for finding a sliver of checks with pocket aces. The other (more important) reason is because if we force the button to check back, we will see a very aggressive, attacking line from the solver in the big blind. Let's look at a 4 of clubs turn, we'll see that the big blind is supposed to lead out here with 45% of its range (and remember, the BB's turn range is the same as their preflop range, so 45% of that range is a LOT of combos). The big blind should stab with so many 4th pairs, 3rd, pairs, top pairs, gut shots, QTo with a club, A5o without a club, and so on. The truth is that a lot of players won't find anywhere near as many of these turn barrels as they should, and vs those more passive players, we will end up missing value on the flop.\n \nSummary \u2013 vs unknown players, recreational players or weaker regs, on these 'high frequency cbet boards' like Q83r and J72r we want to just go ahead and bet our overpairs always. Vs stronger, more aggressive regulars we want to find a very low frequency check with AA and AA only, as we want to allow them to barrel aggressively on the turn.\n \nQ65fd BTN vs BB \u2013 here we will see a higher frequency check overall with our range. We will see our KK bet very often, and we'll see a much higher checking frequency with our AA. There are two different reasons for this. Firstly, we now play a lot more checks with our range, and we have a lot of checks with hands like JJ-77 and so on. If our checking range was only these hands, our opponents could make our life a misery on future streets by putting max pressure on that range, so we need to protect that checking range more with our weaker top pairs, and our pocket aces. There is of course a lot of value to be had here by cbetting AA, but on a wetter/more connected single broadway board like this, it's important that we find these medium frequency checks with our aces to protect our wider checking range.\n \nA second reason that we want to check a hand like AA here is down to its vulnerability. We're betting AA around 80% of the time on Q72r because of how safe it is to do so, but think of how many bad turns and rivers there are now for our top pairs, and our AA. AA is much stronger on Q72r than it is on Q65fd and as a result we want to play a little more conservatively with these top pairs and AA. You won't be able to bet/bet/jam with AA on Q65fd anywhere near as much as you will on Q72r.\n \nThere are of course very few overpairs we can have on Q high & J high boards, so let's take a look at some lower/more connected boards and spots some trends for these.\n \nMiddling T high boards \u2013 let's compare how our overpairs play on T94r, 975r and 987fd. The T9x/T8x/98x disconnected boards are traditionally very good for the BTN here (because of the BB's 3b range), so we can clearly see an extremely high betting frequency with our overpairs. Our JJ-KK are always betting, and our AA are finding at a very small frequency. Very similarly to how we play our AA on J72r, we want to determine the type of opponent we are playing against. If we are playing against a rec, an unknown, or a weaker reg, we want to bet our AA here always. If we are playing against a stronger/more aggressive opponent, we want to bet our AA here at a very high frequency, but finding a small amount of checks to allow them to blast the turn will be higher EV for us.\n \nLet's take a look now at our 975r texture. Our immediate overpairs (TT/JJ) want to bet always. Earlier we had our KK betting on Q72r to get value from A high, but this time round it is very much for protection purposes. Recognising the difference between getting value from overcards and protecting from overcards will help us to understand the purpose behind our bet. If we force the bet here for BTN, we see the BB folding out so many unsuited combos of KJ, KQ, AJ, AT etc. As our pairs get higher, the need for protection gets less important, and we see a drop off in betting frequency with our KK, and very much so with our AA. Our AA betting the least out of all of our overpairs will be a very common trend throughout this module. In single raised pots with a very high SPR and wider ranges, AA becomes a lot more passive on wetter/more connected textures due to its vulnerability.\n \nLet's now take a look at a very low/connected texture like 653fd. We now see a very sharp shift in our strategy. Our immediate overpairs are still betting virtually always, mainly for protection, but also because a hand like 77/88/99 block a lot of the BB's high equity draws like 97s etc. Our pocket pairs ladder up in their checking frequency here, so our immediate overpairs like 77-99 bet always, then TT-QQ bet at a medium frequency, our KK bets quite infrequently, and as always our AA bets the least. We can look at a variety of these low/connected textures to see that the trend is very clear.\n \nI want to finish off this section by looking at a low board that is disconnected. If we look at 832r or 742r, we can clearly see a return to our extremely high betting frequency with our overpairs. If we look at 832fd we can see that our frequencies drop ever so slightly, but we are still betting at a much higher frequency than a board like 653fd. These lead me nicely into the summary for this second part of this first section...\n \nSummary \u2013 we still want to bet extremely often with our overpairs on these lower disconnected boards, whether they are T high or 7 high. As the board gets more middling/connected, we see our immediate overpairs still betting virtually always, and our checking frequencies ladder up the higher our pair is. On the very low/connected boards, we still see our immediate overpairs betting always (for protection purposes), and again we ladder up to the point where our QQ/KK are betting very infrequently, and our AA is betting virtually never.\n \nAA is our overpair that checks the most. This is because it needs no protection, it strengthens our checking range, and we want to allow our opponent to lead on the turn aggressively into a very strong hand of ours. Our AA is so rarely going to be a 3-street-for-value hand on a board like 642fd, so we want to start out with a check very often!\n\n\n \nHow To Play Overpairs\n \nSRPs as the Preflop Caller\n \nWe are going to change the topic of the module slightly for this subsection. Not only will we look at our overpairs, but we will include our top pairs in this section as well. I want to break this part of the module down into 2 different sections...\n \nBB vs BTN \u2013 we are of course not going to look at any A high \u2013 9 high flops because we don't have any overpairs on these boards. We can check our preflop charts to see that we always 3b TT+ preflop, our 9s are mainly a 3b, our 8s are a mix, and then 7s \u2013 2s are virtually always a call preflop.\n \n742r \u2013 let's start by talking a look at how our top pairs play on a board like this. We will see very few raises with our middling top pairs (Q7 \u2013 87), and naturally our strongest top pairs will be raising at a much higher frequency. Our A7 is more inclined to raise because it can get value from hands like J7, T7 etc. We also want to be raising our top pairs with very low kickers on this texture with backdoor draws. The reason for this is that 1) they have backdoor equity in the form of straight/flush draws, and 2) if we force the BB to raise we can see that the BTN is supposed to continue in some form with high-card hands like J9s, but not J5s. So when we have 75s ourselves, we unblock the J highs that have to continue that are doing very poorly vs us. If we have 97s however we block these hands. If we change the board to T53, we can see that we raise our strongest top pairs, and again we raise some of our T6s type hands with a BDFD/BDSD. If we look a little further at a board like K53, we see that the trend of raising our weakest top pairs no longer applies, but we find some KJ-K9s with a BDFD.\n \nIt's also very important to mention that we will face a variety of cbet sizes on these low textures. Our raising range will be very similar whether we face a 33%, 50%, 75%, 100% or 133% cbet, we simply raise more often vs the smaller bets, and much less often vs the larger bets. This relates to all parts of the game tree, not just this topic; when we face larger bets, we raise/call less frequently. When we face smaller bets, we raise/call more often. The two ranges will be very very similar, it's just the frequency that changes!\n \nSummary \u2013 on these low rainbow boards, we want to raise our top pairs with the strongest kicker, our middling top pairs are always calls, and we also want to raise our top pairs with \u201cunder-kickers\u201d to the top card when they have a BDSD/BDFD. This trend of raising our weakest top pairs with backdoor equity does not apply when the board is K63 etc.\n \n6h4s2h \u2013 we are once again playing this board very aggressively overall, check raising around 17% of the time. If we look first at our strongest top pairs, they are still raising, but at a lower frequency than on 732r. This is because our TPTK type hands are more vulnerable on 642fd and therefore we are less inclined to fastplay and bloat the pot with a hand that can easily fall behind on more turn cards. Again, we are really favouring backdoor equity, our A6ss/K6ss raising more often than the cc/dd combos. We can also see a very high raise frequency with our 65s/63s combos. These are our weakest top pairs but again are high equity hands with good unblockers.\n \nTaking a look at our overpairs, we can again see that we want to raise these at a relatively high frequency, and we prioritise having a BDFD in our hand as opposed to not having a BDFD in our hand. I want to quickly address a common misconception about this spot. A lot of people think that we don't want to have a BDFD here, as we want to unblock the flush draw combos we are getting value from. This is a BTN vs BB SRP, ranges are unbelievably wide, so having 77 with a BDFD means you block a tiny portion of the flush draws that the BTN has. There are some other (tighter range) scenarios in the game tree where this is the other way round, but for these wide range spots you want to prioritise having backdoor equity yourself/blocking your opponent's higher equity hands.\n \n \n \nBB vs MP\n \n742r \u2013 let's start off by taking a look at our top pairs, we'll see a very consistent trend of our weakest top pairs with nice backdoor continuing to raise at a medium frequency. We now see very few raises with our semi-strong top pairs, and our TPTK is still getting raised at the highest frequency of all our top pairs, but still not that often in the grand scheme of things. I want to quickly compare our top pairs on 742r with something similar like J52r. We again see that there is very little raising here with any top pairs. We can look at a couple of different textures here to see that the trend is very clear: we do much less raising BB vs MP with top pairs/overpairs than we do BB vs BTN. This is down to how much wider the BTN's range is, and of course how much narrower MP's range is. It's important we still find these low kicker top pairs on the lower boards, but we must be MUCH more call heavy with our top pairs on 9 high \u2013 A high boards.\n \nOn a board like Q52cds, the solver finds a little sliver of x/r with hands like Q4/Q3 with a BDFD, around 20% or so of the time. MP is supposed to cbet, and then float your x/r with hands like JT, 87, etc. Humans will not find these floats, particularly at lower stakes, and therefore their continuing range gets stronger, so we want to reconsider raising these really low top pairs here and strengthen our own range to counteract this. It's also important to note that if our opponent isn't floating with J high as much as they should on Q74, we want to be aggressive with our K6 bdfd, A3 bdfd, 85s etc.\n \nLet's now take a look at how our overpairs want to play on 742r. As we can see, we are now doing MUCH less raising with all of our overpairs. .\n \n642fd \u2013 let's finish off by quickly looking at our value raising range on this lower/more connected flop. We can clearly see that it is very similar to 742r. We want to raise A6 at a reasonable frequency, and then everything else is a call until we get down to our top pairs that also have a straight draw. Our overpairs are still raising really quite infrequently overall, and as mentioned we like to prioritise having a BDFD or unblocking the BDFD.\n \nWe need to be more selective with our TP/overpair raising range when we are MP vs BB compared to when we are BTN vs BB. This is down to MP's raising range becoming a lot narrower (and in actual fact the BB's range becoming wider \u2013 the BB calls more vs MP than it does vs BTN), and as a result we can't raise as liberally with top pairs and overpairs!\n\n\nHow To Play Overpairs\n\n\n3BPs As Preflop Aggressor IP\n\n\n\n\nFor this section we will start off by taking a look at BTN vs CO. We are generally betting so much on A high \u2013 J high boards that we can comfortably skip these and look at middling/low textures.\n\n\n953r/953fd \u2013 the first thing I want to talk about is the difference in size and frequency on a rainbow texture compared to a FD texture. Using the same board will best demonstrate the point I want to make. As we can see, our betting frequency increases slightly on the rainbow texture, and there is also slightly more weight in the larger sizes on a rainbow texture. We tend to play the rainbow textures more aggressively because there will be less higher equity hands in our opponent's range, and we want to bet wider and use bigger sizes. Another way of saying this is that we want to play the flush draw boards more passively because our opponent will have higher equity hands and our range wants to play more conservatively.\n\n\nOn 953r we will see that all of our overpairs are betting virtually always, and our AA /KK find a little sliver of checking back. If we look at 953fd we will see much more checking back with those overpairs. As mentioned above we prefer to play a little more conservatively with our range on FD boards because of how much the board can change. On 953 with two clubs and one diamond, the solver likes to have a club for backdoor equity purposes, but it also really doesn't like to have a diamond, blocking those marginal backdoor equity floats. Note that the solver gets a little erratic here when choosing what combos to bet changing whether it has TT or JJ or QQ or KK. We want to keep our strategy simple here and prioritise having a BDFD, and if possible unblocking the KQdd BDFD type hands ourselves.\n\n\n632r \u2013 I want to take a look now at a much lower, much more connected board. We are used to seeing a bit of a ladder effect with our pocket pairs, with our immediate overpairs betting the most, and then our checking frequency laddering up so that our highest pocket pairs do the most checking. We are going to see more of a \u201chalf moon effect\u201d with our pocket pairs here on this very low texture. Our immediate overpairs are actually going to do a lot of checking, and then our middling pocket pairs are going to do a lot more betting, and then the highest pairs in our range are going to be mostly checking.\n\n\nOur TT-QQ betting region is understandable; they are strong hands, they can get called by a lot of worse hands, and the lower region (TT, maybe JJ as well) benefit from a little bit of protection.\n\n\nOur KK/AA combos starting to check more (with AA checking more often than KK) are understandable; they block the weak \u201cnon pair\u201d portion of our opponent's range that will call, they need a lot less/no protection from overcards, and they help us keep our range balanced for when we have to check our weaker hands.\n\n\nOur 77-99 checking frequency will be a new concept to so many people watching this module. You'd be forgiven for thinking that 77 needs a lot of protection, and therefore wants to bet. If we force the BTN to bet here, we will see that 77 won't get called by enough worse combos, and truth be told, the combos of worse hands that call, are all still doing really quite well. 65 suited, 44, all these types of hands are of course weaker than 77, but they still have a lot of equity when called. When you combine these weaker hands having high equity with the fact that CO still has 88-JJ, and then factor in the flopped sets that we don't have, it's not as appealing to bet our pocket 7s as we may have initially thought. It's like betting AQs with a BDFD here. You're not getting called by enough worse hands, you're not getting any better hands to fold, your are isolating yourself vs a much stronger range when you bet, and therefore your hand prefers to pot control in position instead of betting. It does bet at a very small frequency, because of course there are some worse hands (like AJ/AT suited with a BDFD) that can call. We can use this exact flop when looking at MP vs UTG to see the same logic applies, and we will see a lot of checks with these marginal overpairs once more, with the \u201chalf moon effect\u201d coming into play with our pocket pairs.\n\n\nComing back to BTN vs CO, there are two more boards I want to take a quick look at. If we look at 643r we will see our 77 bet virtually always. This is of course because we have a gutshot, which gives us a lot more equity and allows us to bet our hand. We can clearly see our 88 checking a lot more, and then our 99/TT starting to bet a decent amount. If we were to look at 764r we will see our 88 betting always, and then our 99/TT checking a bit. Lastly if we look at one more disconnected board like 742r, we will see our 88/99 reverting to checking quite often.\n\n\nWe aren't just relentlessly betting our weaker/more vulnerable overpairs in 3BPs; our lowest pairs are doing a decent amount of checking because they will run into stronger hands too often when they always bet. The exception to this is when our immediate overpair has a gutshot (88 on 754 bets always). The middling/higher pocket pairs like 99-QQ on 852 will bet the most, and the we see the top of the \u201chalf moon effect\u201d with our KK checking more, and our AA checking a little more than that!\n\n\n \nHow To Play Overpairs\n \n3BPs As Preflop Caller OOP\n \nWe're going to pick up immediately where we left off in the previous section (3BPs as preflop aggressor IP), and simply mirror the situation. We'll stick with BTN vs CO, and we'll look at how the OOP player wants to play on these textures vs a cbet.\n \n952r \u2013 as we can clearly see, we are supposed to play an aggressive check/raise strategy with our overpairs here. Our TT raising around half the time, and our JJ always. If we look at our top pairs, we'll also see A9 raising a similar frequency to our TT. This is somewhat expected because TT/JJ are quite high pocket pairs, and they'll be quite strong on a variety of boards, and will be able to be called by enough worse hands to justify raising (we have spoken about the threshold in the previous parts of this module). Let's switch now to a lower flop, and see how our overpairs are playing there.\n \n742r \u2013 on this lower texture, we can see that our immediate overpairs like 88-TT are playing much more passively, raising very infrequently, and our JJ is playing the most check/raises. Our TT raises less frequently here because there are less top pairs to get value from (on 952r we can x/r TT because it gets called by J9, Q9 etc, but on 742r our TT can't get called by Q7, J7, T7 because they are not in the BTN's 3b range). There is also a clear preference as to which combos of pocket pairs we prefer to raise. Whilst we raise all combos of TT at some frequency on 8h 5c 2d, we can see that the TT with a spade is preferred. This is because we are trying to get value from hands like AT/KT/QT with a BDFD, and if we have TT with a spade, it's more likely our opponent has one of those combos \u2013 we unblock the overcards with a BDFD a little more. Think about how little equity KJs has when you have JJ, and therefore you want to give yourself the best chance of your opponent having that KJs combo.\n \n6c4c2d \u2013 we have looked at which of our overpairs want to raise, raise more than others, call, and so on, but there's a part of this module that we need to dedicate to folding. A strategy that will likely be completely new to people is calling a 3bet, and just check/folding an overpair out of position. If we look at this flop and force a large cbet for the IP player, we can see that OOP is supposed to fold 77 and 88 without a BDFD. We call 99 without a BDFD, but it is a marginal call at that. If we are to force the BTN to cbet 50%, we will see that even hands like 88/99 without a diamond are very marginal.\n \nThe example above is a wide range vs wide range scenario. If we change the scenario so that it is CO vs UTG and use a flop like 6s 4d 2s, we can see that a similar trend applies. Our 77-99 without a spade are mainly folding.\n \nThe reason for this is because the IP player is supposed to be cbetting quite infrequently overall on these lower/wetter textures, and as a result when they do cbet, their range gets stronger. It is stronger hands + high equity hands, and therefore our marginal middling pairs with no BDFD shrivel up and become really quite weak.\n\n\nHow To Play Overpairs\n\n\n3BPs As Preflop Aggressor OOP\n\n\n732r \u2013 I have purposefully chosen this board texture to highlight a difference between how we play our immediate overpairs OOP compared to when we're IP. In the previous section of this module we saw our 88/99 playing more passively than we might have thought on a board like this. This was because when we broke down the CO's range, our 88 wasn't getting called by enough worse combos/wasn't doing that well vs the CO's continuing range. If we look at the SB's strategy here vs the BTN on this board, we can see that our 88 is the pocket pair that bets the most. This is because, now, our 88 can get called by a lot more worse combos. When the BTN 3bets, the CO calls approx 110 combos. When the SB 3bets, the BTN calls approx 200 combos! This means that our 88 here doesn't need to worry about not getting called by enough worse hands. We can browse the sim to see that there are plenty of worse hands that continue here. The ladder effect very much comes into play here, our 88 bets the most, our 99 a tiny bit less, and so on. As is standard with a lot of what we've seen in this module, our AA is used to protect our range and is used as a high frequency check.\n\n\nLet's take a look and see how we are supposed to play after we check and the BTN stabs for a small size. We can see that every single pair from 88-QQ is check/raising virtually 100% of the time. We are supposed to play extremely aggressively here with our overpairs in the form of a cbet, or a virtually pure check/raise with those mentioned combos. It's important that we find this aggression on these low/disconnected flops.\n\n\nWe are supposed to do a lot of check/calling with AA here. This is because our opponent, as seen, is supposed to absolutely blast off into us with Q high, K high, J high etc type hands. It's really important that we determine the type of player we are playing against and adjust our strategy accordingly. Weaker/more passive players will not bluff as much as they should, and therefore we cost ourselves EV by trapping them. Let's go ahead and x/c vs the more aggressive players who we think will find these non equity bluffs.\n\n\n853fd \u2013 if we look at something a little wetter/more connected, we will see a very similar strategy here. We are cbetting a little less frequently with all of our pocket pairs, but when we do check them, we are playing a high check/raise strategy again. We can look at the specific combos that want to check/raise, and we can see that a backdoor flush draw is very much preferred. You might think that you want to unblock the flush draw so you can get value from them, but flush draws are high equity hands and we prefer to block our opponent's high equity hands + have a little extra backdoor equity ourselves.\n\n\nLet's take a step back from focusing on overpairs for a moment and talk about how our overall range wants to play in this scenario. We will find that our cbet frequency is obviously the highest on boards that are very good for us (K83r etc). As the board gets lower, our frequency decreases. The \u201cnot so great\u201d boards for us (we will say 8 high and below) can be cut into two sections: disconnected and connected.\n\n\nOn a disconnected board like 732r, our global frequency is 45%. We're still betting this board a reasonable amount overall. On an extremely wet connected board like 654fd, our global frequency is 12%. If we look at something in the middle like 753fd, we can see a global frequency of 35%. The wetter/more connected the board, the less frequently we cbet in this spot.\n\n\nThe reason we have zoomed out and looked at how our range wants to play is because we can now take this knowledge and zoom back in and look at how specific parts of our range want to play. Armed with the knowledge that we bet less frequently on wetter/connected boards, we can define our strategy more clearly.\n\n\nOn 732r, our 88-JJ bet virtually always. Our QQ/KK bet 50% of the time. Our AA bets around 25%.\nOn 753fd, our 88-JJ bet less frequently than above, but still very often and our QQ/KK/AA slightly less as well.\nOn 654fd, our 77-QQ bet very infrequently, and our KK/AA virtually never.\n\n\nOn all three examples, if we are checking, we are finding a very aggressive check/raise strategy on all the flops, but the wetter/more connected the board, the less we check/raise overall, whilst still maintaining a relatively high check/raise frequency.\n\n\n \nHow To Play Overpairs\n \n3BPs As Preflop Caller IP\n \nWe are going to continue with our SB vs BTN scenario here, and before we get into specific boards, I want to talk about the difference in our raising strategy on a variety of textures with our entire range. Let's compare how we play vs a large cbet on the following boards...\n \n952r / 952fd\n743r / 743fd\n862r / 862fd\n \n...as we can clearly see, we are playing small raises vs the large bet size on rainbow textures, and we are shoving vs a cbet on the flush draw textures. This is a very consistent trend and one that we must apply to our strategy.\n \nIt's really important to note that the shoving strategy is applied when we face a large cbet (75% pot or above). If we face a cbet of 50% or so (which will be standard in some spots), we revert back to playing smaller raises.\n \nLet's talk about why that is. Normally when we are constructing our range, we build our strategy around our valuebets, and add our bluffs from there. In this spot, however, we are building our strategy around our bluffs. We have some very natural bluffs on 752fd that, when facing a large bet, low SPR etc, they are happy to just go ahead and shove with their equity. On 752r, however, none of our bluffs want to shove. The solver doesn't want to just shovel money in with a minimal equity bluff vs that large bet, so it prefers to use smaller raises. We don't want to just shove all in with minimal equity!\n \nLet's delve into some of these textures now and analyse how our range wants to play. Instead of zoning in on two or three specific boards, let's simply pick a couple of rainbow textures at random, and a couple of flush draw textures, and look for consistencies within the solver.\n \nRainbow \u2013 our raising range is very narrow here, and it's easy to work out what it is. When you have a raising range of 4% or 5%, it's going to be quite ABC and easy to work out. When you have raising ranges of 25% (as is standard in a lot of SRPs), it becomes a bit more complex with some unorthodox combos. If the board is 7 high, we raise our 88-TT. If the board is 8 high, we raise our 99/TT. If the board is 9 high, we are raising our TT, and a little sliver of JJ. The question is, why are we raising these 88-TT combos, but not our JJ/QQ (note QQ rarely flats preflop vs a 3b, but it is in there a little)? There are two reasons. The first one is fairly obvious, we get a little bit of protection. The second reason is that, if we look at a board like 852r for example, when we raise the SB's cbet, the SB is supposed to bet/call with hands like KJs, QJs, AJs, and a few other combos. The SB is not supposed to bet/call with hands like J9s or T9s on this texture. You'll notice that the frequencies that the SB bet/calls with these Q high overcard/BDFD type hands are sensitive and change on a variety of boards, but there are a few floats in there on all the low boards (some more than others) that we want to unblock.\n \nOur overall range is not particularly wide in this spot. Let's take a brief look at some of the weaker hands that accompany our defined overpair range. If we look at 742hdc, we will see that we want to have some A8s with a BDFD, and some A5s as well. Interestingly enough when we have A8s we want the BDFD, but when we have A5s the combo that raises the most is without the BDFD. The reason for this is that A8 is a hand that cannot improve to a really strong hand on the turn, so backdoor equity is preferred. A5s, however, has a gutshot, so we can raise all combos.\n \nFlush draw \u2013 I want to quickly re-iterate the point that we do not play jams vs 50% bet sizes, this is reserved for larger bet sizes. We can use 7d 5d 2c as a great example to illustrate that point. Interestingly enough, if we look at our overpairs here, they want to shove without a diamond in their hand. We've seen a lot of examples throughout this module where the solver likes to have that additional backdoor equity/would prefer to block our opponent's higher equity hands, but when it comes to playing for all the chips, the solver prefers for our opponent to have hands like flush draws in their range. If our opponent bets a large size here and we shove, our opponent's calling range is pocket pairs and flush draws. If we block those flush draws, then it's more likely our opponent has a pocket pair, so we want to allow our opponent to call it off for all the chips with hands like flush draws, and not just strong hands.\n \nLet's take a little look at a few different lower boards to see that the solver is consistent with the types of hands (JJ/TT/certain flush draws) that want to move all in.\n\n\nWhat is the range advantage?\n \nThere are a few different ways to explain what a range advantage is. Simply put, it is whichever players\u2019 range has greater equity at that moment in the hand has the range advantage. The equity that your range has (and therefore who has the range advantage) will shift throughout the entirety of the hand based on a variety of factors. A lot of people simply look at the flop and determine who has the equity advantage, but it\u2019s really important to remember that the equities will change throughout the hand, which in turn dictates what we can and can\u2019t do, so it is a very good habit to get into in terms of thinking about who has the equity advantage throughout the whole hand, and not just on the flop.\n \nFor example, BTN opens, BB defends, the flop is K74fd. The button\u2019s range has 53.46% equity. When the BTN cbets for 33%, it increases to 54.29%. When the BB calls, however, the BTN\u2019s equity drops all the way down to 46.88%. If the BB had decided to raise the flop, the BTN\u2019s equity drops even further to 44.92%, but when the BTN calls the x/r, the equity jumps back up to 53.98%. This is a very quick but very cool example of how the equities change so drastically with just a few clicks.\n \nWhy is this important? Let\u2019s look at another example. BTN opens, BB defends, the flop is 862fd. The BB has 45.93% equity, and when the BTN cbets for 70% and the BB calls, the BB\u2019s equity skyrockets to 53.08%, and if we see the six of clubs on the turn, we can see that the BB\u2019s equity then jumps to 56.65%. That is a huge shift in equity, and understanding what actions and/or what turn/river cards dictate the shift in equities can give a really nice insight into how that affects our strategy.\n \nWhat is the nut advantage?\n \nPut simply, the nut advantage lies with the player that contains more nutted combos in their range. Whilst the range advantage dictates our strategy, it\u2019s not the be-all-and-end-all when it comes to deciding what action to take, and the nut advantage can have a significant impact on our strategy. Taking the time to think about which player has more nutted combos in their range can help you determine things like how often you can/can\u2019t bet, when you can lead out, and when you are forced to check your entire range.\n \nFor example, EP opens, the BB defends, the flop is T97r. EP\u2019s range has a significant equity advantage here of 54.8%, however we can see that, when checked to, EP has to check back here around 60% of the time. This is because the BB has a slight nutted advantage on this board. Both players have TT, 99 & 77 on this board at very similar frequencies, but BB has J8s and 86s always, whereas EP doesn\u2019t have these combos.\n \nIf we take this concept one step further and look at 653r in the same scenario, we can see that the equities of the two ranges are virtually identical, but the BB\u2019s nut advantage is so strong that two things happen: 1) the BB gets to lead out very often here for a small size, and 2) if the BB were to play no leads on this board (and therefore being completely uncapped), the BB\u2019s lack of nutted hands (factored in with so many bad turn cards) force the BB to check back its entire range on the flop.\n \nThese two concepts are both equally important on their own, and often go hand in hand when determining our strategy. Throughout the remainder of this module we will go into more detail about both of them and really focus on how they determine our strategy.\n\n\nShifting Range & Nut Advantages\n\n\n\n\nAs we have seen, almost every action that we take will change the equity each player has in the hand. If we quickly refresh ourselves, we can see that on A82r BTN vs BB, the BTN's equity is jumping up and down based on every action. Understanding the shift in range advantage gives a key insight into our strategy, and how it is affected. For example, if we cbet on A82r, when the BTN calls, our equity is <50% on basically every turn, and therefore our turn barrelling strategy is polarized, and the range that we get to bet is very particular.\n\n\nOn the flipside, if we look at SB vs BTN 3bet pot on 742r, if the SB cbets the flop, we can see that they get to barrel really wide on a variety of turns. This is because those turns are good for the SB, they retain the equity advantage, and therefore they get to be much more liberal with their betting range. It's very important that we understand the difference between the two scenarios, and that we get into the habit of thinking about which actions and runouts give us more or less equity. For example, in example one when we cbet the flop our equity falls drastically, but if we check back on the flop, we still retain an equity advantage on all of the turn cards! As a quick sidenote, it's very cool to see that on A834 we are using a small delay cbet size, and on A83Q we are using a huge size. This is for the exact same reason that we use a big cbet size on AQ4 in SRPs; the pot is small and the solver wants to bloat it very quickly with that nut advantage (we have a nut advantage on A83Q but not so much on A834).\n\n\nSummary \u2013 the equity will change significantly based on actions and runouts, it's important that we are thinking about the changes/retention in equity as it significantly alters our strategy!\n\n\nLet's take a look now at shifts in nut advantage. As we have already seen, the nut advantage changes our strategy and allows us to lead out in certain scenarios, even if we do not hold the equity advantage. This will also very much apply when we arrive to the turn.\n\n\nBefore we look, it's important to note that we've already seen many examples in this module of us having a significant equity disadvantage and a significant nut advantage.\n\n\nSRPs \u2013 let's take a look at 953fd when MP opens and BB defends. If we force MP to cbet here and BB to call, we can see that BB is supposed to lead out so often on so many low/middling turn cards. Our leading strategy is so significant that if we are not implementing it, we are costing ourselves a reasonable amount of EV.  Let's take a look at how much the nut advantage changes on some different turns. On the flop, the nut advantage is somewhat neutral, but on the 6x turn the nut advantage shoots up for the BB. Far more turned straights and turned two pair in BB's range means that the BB should be finding a lot of leads here. When you add in the fact that we already know about the cbettor's equity decreasing because they retain their airballs and the BB's range becomes condensed, it all adds up to one thing \u2013 the BB's range can very much justify check/calling on the flop and leading out on the turn.\n\n\nLet's take a look now at board pairing turns. For this example, we will use BTN vs BB. The first board we will look at is Q76fd. If we force the BTN to cbet, we can see that when the BB calls they want to lead out on every single paired turn card, even the queen at a low freqeuency! If we look at the ranges tab for the 7x turn we can see way more trips combos in the BB's range. We are leading a decent amount here on the 7x and 6x turns, but not as much as we've seen in some other examples where we have the nut advantage. Understanding why that is is very important; the BTN's cbet strategy contains a lot of 7x and 6x. Let's change the board now to 853fd. Before we look at the turn cards we want to be leading on, let's look at the breakdown of BTN's cbetting range, we can clearly see that there are not that many combos of 5x and 3x. This means that when the BTN does cbet on this board, and the BB calls, the BB's turned trips advantage (or turned straight/2p advantage on 6x turns etc) is so significant that they get to lead MUCH wider on the 5x and 3x turns than on the Q76 example.\n\n\n\n\n3BPs \u2013 let's first of all look at a narrow range vs narrow range scenario with UTG vs MP on 872r. Firstly let's look at the paired turns. We'll see that we're just never leading on any board pairing turns, and that may be obvious to some of us, but it's really important that we understand why we don't want to lead here, compared to the many SRP examples we have seen so far. In SRPs we have so many more combos that defend preflop, so on 8728 we have 86s, 85s, K8o, A8o etc, but in a 3bp we have very few 8x combos. There are some turns that we do lead, and these are very clear. Let's investigate the 9x turn, we can clearly see that UTG has way more two pair and straight combos, and therefore a significant nut advantage, and gets to lead out with its entire range here. Our equity is very good on the 3x turn but we never lead, proving that the nut advantage is the reason we get to lead out so much here. We can look at some boards like A84r and K63fd to see that leading is just so rare on any turn cards because we won't have a significant nut advantage, but on these middling boards with lots of turned straights/turned sets that our opponent doesn't have, our range can very much support leading out at a huge frequency.\n\n\nWe can change the scenario to CO vs BTN with wider ranges to see that the above still applies. If we look at a board like 864r, the turns that we get to lead should now be really quite obvious to us. Given the extremity of our nut advantage, our frequency on the turns we want to lead here is basically 100%.\n\n\nWe can also look at some less obvious scenarios now. Let's look at A53r BTN vs CO, after BTN cbets, we can see that there are some turns that the CO gets to lead on. Again, if we really think about the turns that give the CO the nut advantage, our leading strategy should become quite obvious. If we break down both players' ranges on a 2 or a 4 turn we can see that shift in nut advantage, compared to the breakdown on a T turn for example.\n\n\nIf we look at one more board in this scenario, K65r, again BTN cbets and CO calls. There is only one turn card that we want to lead on here, and it's the 7. You might think that we want to lead on a 4 as well, but the difference here is that we fold 44 on the flop, but call 77. Our leading strategy changes drastically over a such a small detail, which means it's really important that we are focused and thinking about all of the intricate details, because one small mistake in our thought process could mean we are leading in spots that we shouldn't be.\n\n\nI want to look at one final scenario here, UTG vs CO 3BP. If we again use our A53r example, we will still see leads on the 4x and the 2x. This tells us that even when our range is narrow, we still find these leads because of our nut advantage. There's one last thing that allows us to lead, and that is the fact that the CO still has so much air in their range (because they get to cbet KQo and KTs) and our range is condensed (because we fold these hands), that our range becomes stronger + we now have the nut advantage = our range can support these leads.\n\n\n\n\n-play tighter multiway, however most dont\n-some people just dont adjust in multiway versus headsup\n-we want to bet with more equity, which means stronger value hands and stronger bluffs versus headsup. Way way less pure bluffs bc so likely someone got a piece. Theres just way more defense when facing more people\n-ranges be tighter value betting, bluffing, check raising, calling, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo notes:\n \n\n\n(0:00) Introduction to BTN vs SB vs BB on 985ss:\n* (0:00) Looking at the BTN vs SB vs BB solution, it\u2019s important to remember that although a GTO villain will 3-bet much more often than call in the SB, when playing live you will often face calls in the SB, so you have to be able to adjust and play against this strategy. \n* (1:10) On 985ss the BTN has a lot of incentive to check behind and not c-bet since the board is so dynamic and even overpairs are likely going to get weaker on later streets and will have to check eventually. The flop is a decent street to check back in position, and we can still get 2 streets on the turn and river. \n* (2:10) Since BTN will check back so often on 983ss, developing a leading range in the blinds is important. We should have fewer leads in the SB however because it\u2019s a worse position than the BB. We\u2019ll probably be leading 2-3 times as much from the BB as from the SB since we are in middle position.\n \n (3:50) Preflop Ranges and Presets for BTN vs SB vs BB on 985ss:  \n* (6:00) Adjust your strategy based on your opponent\u2019s tendencies. A lot of opponents won\u2019t be calling hands like 95s and 85s in the BB, so their range will have less two pairs and be less strong on this board. Always be thinking about how the different parts of the game tree affect future parts. \n* (7:30) If people are playing pretty nitty postflop, they\u2019re probably playing nitty preflop too. \n* (9:00) In multiway pots hands that have better playability are much better. You will value having suited hands even more now, and suited connectors are really strong.\n* (16:40) Even though overall BTN has more equity, BB and SB have more high equity holdings.\n* (24:30) As humans, we want simple solutions for complex ideas. The solver provides those complex ideas, now we have to simplify them and make them implementable. \n* (28:00) Be careful with your bluffing frequencies when playing against players that you play with all the time. If you start over-bluffing a ton you will get caught pretty fast, if you are playing with people who actually pay attention. However, if you are playing in a one off tourney or cash game, you can get away with massive exploitation. \n \n(31:30) SB lead on 985ss:\n* (32:30) We lead 55 with a spade less often than without a spade on the flop. This is because we need less protection when we have the spade, so we can check more often because we can have some backdoor flushes (albeit weak ones). However, when we look at JJ and TT we are betting more often with a spade. This is because these hands are much more vulnerable than a set of fives, so we need to bet them and deny equity from overcards. \n* (44:30) We mix between betting and checking most hands in our range because we want to be disguised and have board coverage on all runouts. Being disguised with very good frequencies is what makes you an exceptional poker player. \n* (54:30) Some hands like QJs will rely heavily on having a backdoor flush draw in order to bet the flop. Having the potential to backdoor into a value hand that can stack off is crucial to deciding which hands to bluff.\n* (56:40) We have to have more value bets than bluffs on the flop because we need to take into account how many bluffs and value bets we\u2019ll have on the river. You can\u2019t have 50% bluffs and 50% value on the flop, otherwise, you\u2019ll show up to the river with way too much garbage.\n* (1:00:00) We build out our ranges by starting with our value, in this case, our 4 combos of straights, and then choose 2 combo draws to bluff. \n* (1:01:40) Versus a 1/3 pot bet from SB, BB over-folds massively (40%), calls 47%, and check-raises 12%. The Minimum Defense Frequency (MDF) is 25%, but you have to remember that in multiway pots the MDF is shared between the BB and BTN when the SB bets. \n* (1:06:30) Whether or not you have the nut flush blocker is crucial in determining whether your hand can raise the flop (on 985ss).\n* (1:09:00) Monkersolver doesn\u2019t differentiate between 0 EV and -EV folds, so keep that in mind because obviously, not all folds are equal. \n* (1:15:00) Having the ace of spades is such an important blocker because when our opponents have the ace of spades we will face a lot more aggression from them. When we hold it we can tune up the aggression, because our opponents will be less aggressive. \n* (1:17:00) When opponents tend to over-fold, many of our 0 EV bluffs quickly shift to +EV because we are over-realizing equity versus a nitty opponent. \n* (1:22:30) The pairs that we fold facing a SB bet on this board are the bottom pairs that have no real additional equity in the form of backdoor flushes and straights.\n* (1:32:00) We can simplify the solver\u2019s frequencies by selecting a few hands and betting them at a 100% frequency, instead of betting a larger amount of holdings at a lower frequency. For example, if we raise a certain frequency of several suited Kx holdings, we can just simplify and raise K7s and K6s, and do away with raises for the rest of them. \n \n(1:35:00) BTN vs SB lead, BB raise on 985ss: \n   * (1:36:00) BTN folds 81%, calls 17%, and only raises 1.4% versus a SB lead and BB raise. Raises include a mix of flush draws, sets, and some hands like middle pair with backdoor and front door draws.  \n   * (1:39:00) Solver always pairs it\u2019s aggressive value raises with bluffs that have a decent amount of equity when called. There aren\u2019t any airball raises here. \n   * (1:42:20) Facing a bet and a raise solver is folding most of its overpairs if they do not include a spade. \n   * (1:51:00) We are folding 64 of spades here, which really shows the value of studying solvers since most players would likely continue with the straight and flush draw. We even fold some king-high flush draws when they don\u2019t also have a straight draw, while most players would probably continue.\n   * (2:02:15) We can turn a lot of our calling hands into re-raising candidates if we think that our opponents are going to over-fold to a flop 4-bet. This is another way you can exploit players who play passively. If we think that these players are a bit tighter and probably have good hands more often, we can take some of the bluffs out of our 4-betting range and replace them with value hands that were protecting our calling range as an exploit.  \n   * (2:10:00) When SB 5-bet shoves, BB calls 24% which includes straights, sets, and some flush draw and straight draw combos. However versus most opponents, when faced with big all-ins we need a set or better to continue.\n   * (2:13:30) Versus a SB and BB all-in, BTN folds some 55 but calls 88, 99, and straights. Also called at some frequency are the straight flush draws and ace-high flush draws. Remember that ranges are tighter in real life than solver, so your calling range should probably be a bit stronger than this in most live scenarios.\n   * (2:17:30) Versus a BTN 4-bet and a SB all-in, BB folds almost 100% of 55 and basically only continues with 88, 99, and 76.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView Video Notes\n* (0:00) SB\u2019s baseline bet frequency on 985ss is just 12% for a 1/3 pot bet, checking almost 88% of the time.\n* (1:10) BB opens the pot (after SB check) almost 50% of the time for a 1/3 pot sizing.\n* (1:30) BTN c-bets almost 62% after SB and BB check.\n* (2:00) When you have a big bet option on a sim the betting frequency will usually decrease. When we bet we want our range to be pretty polarized, meaning that our bets will be less frequent. A smaller bet means that we can bet more linearly, with a wider range of hands.\n* (3:20) Versus a BTN c-bet SB check-raises 13.4%, calls 51.9% and folds 34.7%. \n* (4:00) Versus a BTN c-bet BB basically never check-raises (1.3%), calls 63.8%, and folds 35%. This is due to the fact that we already have a complex leading strategy from the BB, if we checked 100% of the time we would definitely have a considerable amount of check-raises. \n* (9:00) Versus a SB 33% lead BB raises 12%, calls 47%, and folds 40%. Versus a SB 33% lead BTN raises 16%, calls 68%, and only folds 15%. \n* (11:20) Versus a BB 33% l;ead BTN raises 15%, calls 55%, folds 29%.\n* \n\nView Video Notes\n* (6:40) We typically want to pair our high equity bluffs with the same line we take with our high equity value in multiway pots.\n* (10:50) Versus a BTN c-bet, SB is playing the majority of its sets as a check-call as opposed to a check-raise. This is because there are a lot of bad turns and rivers where SB won\u2019t be able to get three streets with its sets, because either the flush or a 4 to a straight card is likely to come. So, the solver protects its check-call range with sets. \n* (13:40) We can check-call an underpair as the SB as a breakeven play. Most Small Blinds will over-fold for sure, not many players will be calling 22-44 on the flop here with BB behind. \n* (16:10) The BB never checks a set or a straight, choosing to lead them at almost a 100% frequency. \n* (18:00) BB is capped when they check, there are a ton of value hands that lead flop at a high frequency and they can have straights, sets, two pairs, etc when they bet. When they check however they are pretty capped, that\u2019s why there is almost no check-raising done by BB (1.3%). \n* (21:40) SB check-raises all of its straights, balancing with some ace-high flush draws and other flush draws. 2nd and 3rd pairs with a gutshot also check-raise, these hands are very playable over future streets.\n* (26:30) It\u2019s important to remember that these frequencies will change drastically if you are playing against a looser opponent. Our mediocre holdings go up in value and we can play more aggressively overall. \n* (34:00) Top pair holdings that don\u2019t have many backdoor possibilities like straights or flush draws make for better calls than raises. When raising top pairs make sure you have some backdoor equity to fall back on. This goes for second pair holdings as well, without additional draw equity that are only calling. Strong pair + flush draw or straight draw combos actually play pretty aggressively and raise often.\n\n\n\n\nView Video Notes\n* (0:00) We want to look to pair our best value hands with our best bluffs, and pair our worst value hands with our worst bluffs. Our worst bluffs and value may just bet one street, and our best bluffs and value may go for three streets. \n* (3:35) The core bluffs in our betting range are the strong ones, but we still have to find more so we\u2019ll have some secondary bluffs that solver sprinkles in at a low to medium frequency. Without these secondary bluffs, we couldn\u2019t be balanced, because when we hit our high equity bluffs on future streets we\u2019ll need bluffs in our range still. \n* (10:30) Most of our secondary bluffs will be 1 street bluffs unless they hit additional equity on the turn. \n* (13:50) Our worst value bets are the 8x holdings, which will look to bet one street and go into bluff catching mode most often, if unimproved.\n\n\n\n\nView Video Notes\n* (3:00) Many of the fringe/borderline folds that we make in the BB facing a SB lead are hands that can also call, especially if you think your opponent is pretty loose. Hands like ace-ten of diamonds are being folded some of the time, it\u2019s up to your in-game reads as to whether or not you want to actually fold this combo. \n* (9:40) The weakest pairs that have good blockers (that have more strategic options across future streets) are the fridge holdings that are borderline indifferent between calling and folding. \n* (10:50) We always continue with gutshots that have good blockers, while folding gutshots that don\u2019t have any blockers. \n* (13:30) When SB bets, BB calls, BTN\u2019s over-calling range is decently wide (47%). However, we almost never call our weak pairs, only continuing with the flush draw + pair holdings (mainly by raising them). \n* (17:10) The majority of the time when you have an overcard with a backdoor straight or flush draw you\u2019ll be continuing in position (after SB bets, BB calls). Without this additional equity, your overcards will mainly be folding.\n* (25:40) In multiway pots, when we face a 1/3 c-bet we basically never fold a pair, and the fringe holdings include gutshots and good overcards. The only time we fold our weak pairs is when we face a 1/3 pot bet and a call, and then it\u2019s only the weakest pairs that fold. You\u2019ll notice in-game that people tend to fold a lot wider than this, so you can adjust your strategy accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\noop srp^ bc in srp oop, there calling range is more dense on stronger hands and we have more air and are forced to check more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDowbload to all the boards oop srp utg vs button (has turns as well).

The reason for this is that we have an equity disadvantage, we are OOP, and as ever when we are playing a very high flop x strategy we simply prefer a larger cbet size.\n \nAs with any aspect of poker, when we are the preflop aggressor and play a high frequency flop x strategy, we need to have a solid freq x/r strategy.\n \n987 we x/r approx 16%\n653 we x/r approx 16%\n853fd we x/r approx 20%\n732r we x/r approx 20%\n \nOur x/r's are obvious on the straight draw flops, but on 732r type flops we elect to choose hands like KQs with a BDFD, A4s, overpairs at a much higher frequency etc.\n \n \nMiddling connected flops\n \nAs above, we play a very high flop x strategy. Even though our range connects a little better with T high/J high flops, the IP player still has an equity advantage on all of the flops we have run. Again, the more turned straights possible, the more frequently we check.\n \nJT9 we x 100%\nT86 we x 100%\nT54 we x 60%\nT52 we x 73%\n \nAgain, when we are checking so wide, we need to play a solid x/r strategy on these boards, and it is a similar sort of range that wants to x/r.\n \n \nA high flops with no additional broadways\n \nThese are relatively tricky to simplify as the solver is quite erratic. On these textures we are going to play a check frequency of approximately 70%. The best way to simplify is to group all of these flops together and play them as similarly as possible. On the disconnnected flops we use a 33% size, on the wheel flops we use a 75% size.\n \n \nWhen we are playing a strategy that involves so many checks, we bet our strongest top pairs at a high frequency, and we 'ladder down' and bet our weakest top pairs at a much lower frequency.\n \nWe x/r very rarely on these flops. The reason for this is the IP player will use a larger size a lot and we don't x/r very much at all vs a larger size. We can exploitatively x/r a little wider than the solver suggests with our value because people will stab less with bluffs on this board.\n \n \nOne broadway flops\n \nAs we can see from the spreadsheet our equity is pretty neutral in this spot on the Q high and J high boards, but we have a slight equity advantage on the K high flops. We can make a solid simplification of what boards to bet wider on/what boards to check wider on, and it's to do with the remaining two cards. If they are middling/connected we don't cbet as often. If they are lower than a 6 we can bet them a little wider. The preflop charts give us a great indication as to why that is.\n \nThe preferred size varies quite a lot, but I am going to recommend a 33% flop size in these situations; if we bet 33% on Q75r are our opponents floating T9s, A3s, 22 etc? Probably not, so I would elect to use the smaller size when betting!\n \nBoards that are good for the OOP player's range (finally!)\n \nThe main type of boards that are consistently good for the OOP player are double broadway boards. Despite this we do need to play a very high frequency check strategy on some of these textures. The boards that we can cbet the most are AKx  and KQx type boards with a low third card...\n \nAgain, when the solver is so erratic we need to devise a simplified strategy that is easy to implement. My advice would be to still check the A high flops and the Q high flops at a decent frequency, and to bet the KQx, KJx etc type flops at a much higher frequency than the rest of the data we have seen so far!\n \n \nMonotone flops\n \nWe continue to play a very high flop x strategy on monotone flops. The trend of what flops we can bet wider than others is consistent (low/connected flops are range checks, higher flops we have some betting frequency)...\n \n764sss we x 100%\n962sss we x 100%\nQ83sss we x 80%\nAQ2sss we x 70%\nK53sss we x 55%d\n\nWe don't x/r very much at all on monotone boards, and we keep it simple and x/r our A2-A5ss that unblock our opponent's flush draws, and mix in some Ax/Kx of spade type hands.\n\n\nCO vs button pt 2:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f0S_XGzQQkG3a875QKNfej_U7fW-DGelnuOdC3O-A9o/edit#gid=0\n\n\n\n\nCO flop strategy (OOP)\n\n\n\n\nLow or middling connected flops\n\n\nThe difference between MP and CO's strategy is significant; there are certain flops that MP could bet sometimes in this spot, but that so rarely applies to CO. CO is doing a ton more checking, and has a lot more flops that it wants to check its entire range (or close enough to it that we want to simplify).\n\n\n987 we check 100% (same as MP)\n653 we check 100% (MP was 90%)\n853 we check 100%  (MP was 70%)\n732 we check 87% (MP was 70%)\n\n\nBefore we look at the x/r range in these spots let's look at some flops that are slightly higher...\n\n\nT86 we check 98%\nT54 we check 98%\nT52 we check 99%\n\n\nIf we look at our spreadsheet, it's clear to see that as our range gets wider we are checking so unbelievably often OTF in so many situations. We can essentially simplify and say that any flop that is 10 high and below we check our entire range.\n\n\nWhat is the reason for this? Our range has gone from 21% to 29%, but the BTN's range is still around 5.5%. This means that our range gets wider, our equity goes down and therefore we have to do a ton of checking CO vs BTN.\n\n\nHow does this affect our x/r strategy? Let's take a look.\n\n\nAs we will see, we will x/r more combos CO vs BTN than we will do MP vs BTN, but the frequency will only go up slightly because the range is wider. So a perfect example is on 732r our x/r frequency will go up slightly, but the physical number of combos will increase drastically. The reason for that is in MP we have no T7s, 97s, J7s etc, but we do have these hands in CO, and they want to x/r sometimes. We also have more 'two-over-BDFD-BDSD' type hands. The summary for this is our x/r range is roughly the same, but on disconnected flops we want to x/r more with our TP hands/backdoor draw hands/overpairs, because we have more of them!\n\n\n\n\nA high flops with no additional broadways\n\n\nCO does a ton more checking on these flops as you'd expect. The MP player likes to bet A43, A52 type boards and check on A83 type disconnected boards, whereas the CO does the opposite. I think it's a far superior strategy to play in MP the same as CO does (i.e. we check wide on the wheel A high flops, but bet the disconnected flops at a slightly higher frequency).\n\n\nOur x/r range is very similar to MP vs BTN, we want to x/r our strongest top pairs, and any hands that have equity (e.g. K6ss on As6s2x). On the more disconnected A high boards, we x/r at a higher frequency, and when we have no 'natural bluffs', we want to x/r hands like J8dd on A94dsc etc (bdsd/bdfd type hands).\n\n\nDouble broadway boards\n\n\nThere are two different categories here; boards that we check really wide on, and boards that we bet really wide on. The strategy for boards that we check really wide on is very similar to MP vs BTN, however on the boards that we want to bet really wide on (AKx, KQx etc) we can actually bet these at a WIDER frequency than MP vs BTN. The reason for this is again down to preflop. We're opening a wider range, and therefore we have significantly more Kx and Qx hands that connect with these flops, and therefore our range is doing very well on them.\n\n\nAgain, the Q high and J high flops are not as good as the K high flops, so we do play a relatively higher checking frequency on these.\n\n\nThe preferred size that we want to cbet varies from board to board. I strongly recommend a 33% cbet size for simplification purposes, as people will not float as wide as they should in theory, and thus our bluffs are cheaper.\n\n\nGiven IP prefers a larger stab size on these flops, our x/r frequency is relatively low, and as ever when it is relatively low it's easy to work out what hands we want to x/r.\n\n\n\n\nMonotoned flops\n\n\nOur strategy is slightly different CO vs BTN on these boards. Again, on the low boards like 962sss, 764sss etc we want to play a pure flop check, but on the double broadway boards we want to bet slightly more frequently. Much like MP vs BTN, our x/r strategy is going to revolve around hands like A2-A5ss, and a mixed frequency with NFDs/2nd NFDs.\n\n\n \nBTN vs MP flop strategy (IP)\n \nLow/middling connected flops\n \nThe MP player plays a high check strategy on these flops with a big sized cbet. This is because their range has less equity and therefore they must check a lot. On the flip side to that our range has a lot of equity, and therefore we can stab relatively wide for a 33% size. The range that wants to bet is really even amongst all the hands that we have. We check a little more with our AT/AJ/AQ showdown type hands, and we bet wide with our KT/QJ/K9 etc type hands, regardless of whether or not we have a FD or BDFD.\n \nThe solver is very consistent with regards to stabbing frequencies...\n \n963r we stab 61%\n842fd we stab 56%\n987fd we stab 75%\n765fd we stab 65%\nT54r we stab 60%\n \nThere doesn't appear to be any simplification that we can make on these boards. It appears that we simply stab a variety of different hands at a decent frequency.\n \nWhen we do bet and we get x/r'd, we continue with a very standard range of pairs/draws. We have some very marginal floats that we can simply just fold. People won't x/r flops anywhere near as much as they should, so when they do we can fold hands like KJs on 732r. We simply continue with equity.\n \nOur 3bet frequency is so low on all of these boards, approx 5% total. We can essentially 3b the top of our range and a couple of strong draws. 987ssd and 842dss are perfect examples.\n \nWhen our opponent does cbet on these types of boards our raising frequency is extremely low, capped at approx 5% (and sometimes not raising at all). 532fd, 732r are perfect examples of how our strategy changes depending on the size that OOP uses.\n \nA high flops with no additional broadways\n \nThe solver is mixing sizings here. It is betting 75% on connected boards like A54fd, A74fd, and it chooses 33% on less connected flops like A83r, A72r etc. My advice would be to choose one size across all low A high boards and use 75%. We stab a mixture of everything, but we check back hands like KQ and KJ and our lowest TPs  at a very high frequency. Note that we use 22-55 as a high frequency stab, they unblock a lot of villain's folding range!\n \nNote that we do a lot of checking back on these textures. When you combine our low stab frequency and our 75% sizing, MP should not be raising us very much at all (3 or 4% frequency on average). On the rare occasion we do get raised we proceed VERY cautiously (as shown by unticking 'square size to proportional weight' in PIO.\n \n \nOne broadway flops\n \nSimilarly to the above flops, the solver is stabbing at quite a high frequency for the 33% sizing. The range also looks quite similar; a mixture of everything with some SDV hands checked back at a higher frequency. The general trend is that when we have more equity, we stab a balanced range of hands around 60% of the time. When we get x/r'd we do a fair amount of folding (given how wide we're stabbing) and continue with stronger parts of our range only. Our preferred sizing is still 33%.\n \nGeneral trend appears to be on the lower boards that are better for our range we stab around 60-65% of the time. On the boards that get better for OOP we stab less, around 50%.\n \nOn boards like Q75r and J63r when x/r'd the solver likes to float hands like KTbdfd, A4bdfd etc. Let's never do this for very obvious reasons!\n \nSummary \u2013 respect aggression from our opponents and don't float too much K high type hands\n \n \nDouble broadway flops\n \nWhen checked to on low connected flops we can bet really wide for a small size because we have an equity advantage and connect well with these boards. The opposite applies on boards like KQ2, QT5 etc. We now become more polarised with our betting range, we check back around 66% of the time, and we stab for a 75% size when we do bet.\n \nOur range that wants to stab on these textures are obvious. Gutshots, straight draws, flush draws, stronger TPs and 2p+.\n \nIn terms of our bluffs we have the obvious 'natural bluffs', we also use our low PPs that unblock our opponent's folding range, and also hands like A3s-A5s that have a BDFD/BDSD\n \nAgain, given how rarely we get x/r'd here, we only continue with good equity hands; perfect example is on KT3ssd, we bet/fold AQo with no spade.\n \n \nMonotone flops\n \nMonotone flops continue with the trend of everything we have just learned in terms of stabbing frequency, the only difference is we always prefer a 33% size when stabbing. Broadway boards we are stabbing around 25% of the time, lower more connected boards we want to stab around half the time. It's interesting to note we still stab hands like JThh at a relatively high frequency on 962sss. Note that we bet less frequently on a board like J85sss (and even less on K53sss). Essentially the lower the board the more frequently we stab\n \nPlease note that on a board like 963sss we can stab really wide with our airballs, but on these K hi, A hi etc monotone boards these overcard type hands are non existant, and that drives down our betting frequency\n\n\n\n\nBTN vs CO flop strategy (IP)\n\n\n\n\nLow or middling connected flops\n\n\nAs you'll remember we chose to simplify our strategy as the OOP player and check everything that is T high and below. The reason for this is important; the equity that OOP has on a lot of these boards is very low. This also means that the IP player can stab extremely wide. The trend appears to be that the lower/more connected the flop, the more frequently IP can stab.\n\n\n532s \u2013 80%\n765s \u2013 90%\n853s \u2013 82%\n743r \u2013 62%\n\n\nThere are a few flops that prefer to use a more polarised strat of stabbing less/using a larger size. I've created a quick aggregate report to show that it's pretty obvious what these are, T92, T87, T86 etc.\n\n\nAs we can see from the doc, these are so few and far between that we want to just simplify and use the 33% size on all T high flops and below.\n\n\n\n\nA high flops with no additional broadways\n\n\nI've put a little table below to show the difference in the BTN's strategy vs MP and CO. This helps us to see more clearly the general trend...\n\n\nFlop        BTN stab freq vs MP        BTN stab freq vs CO\nA83r        36.00%        51.00%\nA94r        35.00%        52.00%\nA53fd        29.00%        36.00%\nA62fd        35.00%        35.00%\nA63r        35.00%        50.00%\n\n\n\n\nThe general trend is obvious; the more disconnected the flop, the more we stab. The more connected the flop, the more identical our strategy is vs MP. The reason for this is the BTN has slightly more equity vs CO on these boards (        , and therefore BTN can stab wider vs CO than it can vs MP \u2013 the wider the OOP range, the better the IP player does on a lot of textures).\n\n\nIt's interesting to note that vs MP (and UTG although we don't have the data to back that up) we are more polarised when we bet here and use the 75% size. The solver is actually very consistent and likes to use a 33% size when stabbing a bunch of these disconnected A high flops, and uses a 75% size on the low/connected/wheel flops.\n\n\nI will leave it up to you to build your own strategy in this exact spot \u2013 if you want to use one size on all A high flops then choose 75%. If you feel confident to use 33% on A high disconnected flops and 75% on low/wet flops, that's completely fine. We can choose one of these two options and apply it to BTN vs MP and BTN vs CO. Just be consistent!\n\n\nOur opponent's x/r strat will be dependent on our stab size. Note how tight the solver x'rs vs the big size compared to the small size.\n\n\n\n\nOne broadway flops\n\n\nAs expected, the trend continues and our strategy is very similar vs CO as it is vs MP, the difference is we stab a bit wider. I've chosen a few flops and insterted a table again to re-iterate this point...\n\n\n\n\nFlop        BTN stab freq vs MP        BTN stab freq vs CO\nQ76r        51.00%        60.00%\nK73r        54.00%        56.00%\nJ54r        56.00%        63.00%\nK87fd        49.00%        44.00%\nQ74fd        50.00%        56.00%\n\n\nAs we can see from the table, we stab at a slightly higher frequency on the Q high and J high boards, but our strategy is consistent on the K high boards (again we don't replicate the solver identically, we just know that we can comfortably stab a little more vs CO than we can vs MP).\n\n\nOur range that continues vs a x/r is virtually identical. We continue with hands that have equity, we fold our low PPs and we continue with any flopped pairs.\n\n\nSummary \u2013 on these flops our strategy is extremely similar vs CO as it is vs MP, we just stab a little more!\n\n\n\n\nDouble broadway flops\n\n\nOn these boards our opponent is going to cbet more than any other type of board we've seen so far. We actually play a decent frequency raising range when we face a cbet. We tend to raise our bottom set always, our top two pair a decent amount, and we scatter in some high equity bluffs (note that we have a lot of natural bluffs here so we don't really need to find any unnatural bluffs).\n\n\nThe difference in raising ranges on QJ2fd and KJ3r is quite interesting.\n\n\nSimilarly to the single broadway section, our strategy is actually virtually identical, we just stab at a slightly higher frequency. Whilst the solver does appear to prefer a 33% size more often, it's not significant enough for us to want to change our sizing scheme (in other words we still use 75% when checked to as we are betting polarised).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonotone flops\n\n\nThe solver appears to be really consistent here with regards to strategy/stabbing frequency (which is great!). The strategy is therefore really similar vs CO as it is vs MP; on boards that have high cards/are better for OOP's range we don't stab anywhere near as much as we do on low/connected boards. Again the reason for this is on something like 963sss we can stab JThh/QTdd etc but on K53/KJ9sss we don't want to stab these hands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMP turn strategy (OOP)\n\n\nThere are a bunch of different ways that we can get to the turn, flop can go x/x, we can x/c, we can x/r, we can cbet and villain calls, we can cbet and call a raise etc etc. This makes for a very broad topic within the module. To make the best use of our time we are going to pick several different flops on a range of different boards and look at each of these scenarios within that flop. Instead of looking at one flop from start to finish, we are going to look at the actions on each flop.\n\n\nPlease note that on flops that we check really wide on, we still check a ton on the turn, at most we're betting at around a 50% frequency. The reason for this is that we still have an equity disadvantage in theory even after flop goes x/x.\n\n\nAfter flop goes x/x\n\n\n653fd/986fd - we are uncapped because we x our entire range, but our opponent has weakened his range, because he doesn't x back strong hands all that often. We tend to bet 33% on straight and flush completing turns. The solver plays differently on these two textures but I think favouring a 33%/75% sizing scheme is going to be higher EV than using overbets in general.\n\n\nSummary \u2013 on any flop that we x our entire range on, we are going to use a 33% size on any straight/flush completing card or any Q/K/A, and we're going to bet 75% on any bricks.\n\n\n732r - as above, our opponent's range gets weaker after flop goes x/x, but ours still stays the same given we have a high x freq (whilst not quite checking our entire range).\n\n\nT54r \u2013 again, in theory we do a ton of overbetting here on the low cards, the board pairing cards and the high cards, and we elect to use a smaller size for everything in between. This appears to be a significant trend on these low/middling flops.\n\n\nSimplifcation \u2013 we have decided that we want to use the overbet size on board pairing cards when the card that pairs is lower than a 7. E.g. on 732 we are going to overbet a 7, 3 or 2, but on T54 we are going overbet a 5 or a 4. As ever, we are going to use a 33% size on Q, K, A turns because our opponents won't stab flop as much as they should with their broadway airballs and therefore they will have more turned TPs in their range than they should.\n\n\nQ42r \u2013 similar to the above board, we do a lot of overbetting in theory on the high cards, and anything in between chooses a more merged 75% sizing. When we compare this to something like J63r the strategy is quite different, and I think a 33% size is going to work really well again here on the overcards. We're going to use 75% on all bricks essentially.\n\n\nJT9fd - on these high connected flops we can use a small turn stab after flop x/x on every turn. This is consistent with all flops of this kind (e.g. KQ9fd was the exact same).\n\n\nKJ3r - it's interesting to note that the solver rarely uses a 75% sizing. The trend we've seen so far is an overbet on small cards and big cards, and a 33% size on straight completing cards. The big cards in this instance are straight completing cards, and the solver still appears to prefer a 33% size. This means that 33% clearly takes priority.\n\n\nSummary \u2013 any flops that are 2 broadways or more, we can bet really wide OTT after x/x for 33% size. This is relatively consistent within the solver when we DON'T bet too wide OTF, but we can even use this strat on flops that we do bet relatively wide on (e.g. on KQ9fd we're not supposed to bet too wide OTF, but on KJ3r we are \u2013 the turn strat of 33% stab is going to be consistent on both these textures).\n\n\nA83r \u2013 the solver loves a 33% turn probe on so many different turns here. We can check this with A43fd and AJ9r to confirm that the solver is consistent with this strategy. The exception to this rule appears to be on a king turn across all the different boards, where it prefers an overbet.\n\n\nSimplifcation \u2013 overbet on low board pairing cards, low cards in general and broadway cards. Bet 33% on straight/flush completing cards. Bet 75% on middling cards. 33% takes priority. On A high flops our turn probe size is just 33% always (but we can overbet a king if we want to remember that).\n\n\n\n\nWhen we x/r flop\n\n\n653fd \u2013 the solver is mixing between 33, 75 and 125. I really like the idea of using 33% and 100% as a simplifcation/compromise. We check more on connected turns that complete straights and/or flushes, and when we do bet we bet 33%. We bet broadway cards at a higher frequency, and we use a larger size when we bet these. We also use the pot size on board pairing cards. Really important \u2013 we continue on the turn with equity, we give up our airballs!\n\n\n732r \u2013 the solver is reluctant to use the smaller size on this texture, generally favouring 75% and 125% (we're obviously going to use 100% instead). Interesting to note the difference in strategy on straight completing cards on this texture. We should use 33% on the lower cards and then pot on the larger cards. This is a simplifcation which gives us a solid, consistent strategy.\n\n\nT54r \u2013 the solver is proving consistent with big sizing on low pairing cards. Interestingly it likes to use a smaller size on bigger cards on this texture. I am going to combine T54r and Q42r here. As we can see Q42 doesn't apply this small sizing throughout. I think we can simplify and say that we want to use 33% on straight completing cards and overcards, but a pot size on anything else. I think this strategy is going to be far easier to implement.\n\n\nSummary \u2013 on a board like 653fd we don't xr too much KQs, AJs etc so when the broadway cards come OTT we can still use pot, but on a board like 732, T54 etc where we do xr a ton of BD broadways OTF, we can elect to use a 33% size OTT when these hit. Also on T54 there are so few bricks that don't complete a straight that we rarely use a PSB, but on Q42 there are a lot more and therefore we have more PSBs in our range.\n\n\nJT9fd - given how narrow our flop x/r range is, we essentially always have some equity OTT. We elect to continue to bet with the higher equity hands (e.g. we give up with bdfd K8s but keep betting the K8s with a flushdraw). Our size is always pot because of how narrow a range we are betting.\n\n\nSummary \u2013 any flop that is high broadway and really connected, we elect to continue OTT with a PSB because both ranges have become drastically narrower. We only continue with our strong draws.\n\n\nKJ3r \u2013 again we don't x/r this flop too often, which means our turn barreling range is easy to work out. Similar to above, in any spot we don't x/r wide OTF we prefer to use a large turn size throughout.\n\n\nA83r \u2013 again, not x/r'ing too often here. We are going to use the bigger size when we do bet the turn. We can compare this flop to A43fd and see that the solver prefers the larger size even on a wetter board.\n\n\nSimplification \u2013 in general when we don't xr too wide OTF we are more polarised OTT and prefer to use the pot size. On the flipside when we do x/r really wide OTF we elect to use a 33% size on a bunch of different turn cards (mainly overcards/straight completing cards).\n\n\n\n\nWhen we x/c flop\n\n\nGeneral notes\n\n\nWe don't do very much check raising OTT after we x/c flop. We can x/r hands like turned 2p, any sets that elected to xc the fop, and also any turned combo draws we may have.\n\n\nWe start to x/f our underpairs/weaker holdings, even more than the solver suggests. Our opponents don't stab turn enough, and therefore these more marginal hands become easy folds.\n\n\nWe can look at a few different textures to get a feel for what hands we want to continue with OTT, but the general strategy is the same. Continue with equity, x/r strong hands and strong draws, and start to fold our weaker pairs etc\n\n\n\n\nWhen we bet the flop and BTN calls\n\n\n653fd/JT9fd \u2013 we x our entire range OTF so this is n/a.\n\n\n732r \u2013 the solver recommends using a 33% size on a range of turn cards. Given we bet 75% OTF I am not a fan of 'big flop small turn' strategies, so any flop we bet 75% on, we should use 75% and 125% OTT. We are overbetting board pairing cards and using 75% on anything else. Note how infrequently we bet smaller cards here, and how much more often we continue on broadway cards\n\n\nT54r \u2013 very similar to above strat in terms of overbetting low paired cards, and using 75% on anything else. Again we are betting broadways at a much higher frequency than low bricks.\n\n\nQ42r \u2013 this is the first time we've seen the solver overbet OOP on the turn. It's not often we see an OOP overbet on a majority of turns. If we look at T62 and J63 it would appear that there isn't much overbetting going on, and Q42 appears to be the exception rather than the rule. If we look at K32 it appears to want to overbet too.\n\n\nSimplifcation \u2013 our general sizing scheme is that we want to use an overbet on all bricks and all low board pairing cards, and a 75% size on overcards/straight completing cards.\n\n\nSimplification - If we use a big size OTF, we can use a big size again OTT. If we use 33% OTF, the solver actually likes using 33% again OTT.\n\n\nKJ3r \u2013 the solver much prefers 33% OTF here, which means that we follow the rule and bet 33% OTT when we do want to bet.\n\n\nA83r \u2013 again, we want to bet small OTF here, which means we bet small OTT according to the solver. We can check this against A43fd, which does prefer a bigger sized cbet, and sticks to the rule of big/big.\n\n\n\n\nSimplifcation \u2013 when it comes to flop/turn sizes we can have small/small, small/big and big/big, but never big/small.\n\n\nSimplification \u2013 the more frequently we bet on the flop (i.e. with a 33% size), the more likely we are to use a 33% size OTT. On the flipside the less frequently we bet on the flop (i.e. with a 75% size) the bigger our turn size.\n\n\n \nCO turn strategy (OOP)\n \nThis section of the module will not be as thick as the previous section (MP turn strategy) as it is a comparison of how CO plays compared to how MP plays. We're looking for similarities/trends that we can use as best as possible, and the strategies are very similar.\n \nAfter flop goes x/x\n \nWe know that we have simplified and checked our entire range on these T high and below textures.\n \n653/986fd \u2013 as mentioned in the previous part of the module, the solver actually quite likes using either 33% or 125%, with the larger size being favoured slightly more. Again, I don't think our opponents stab hands like KTs, KJo etc as much as the solver suggests, so for exploitative reasons I think we should favour the 33% size much more heavily on these broadway cards. Note that we are choosing between these two options because the solver just never uses 75%.\n \nThe lower the board, the more we overbet a board pairing card (i.e. on 653ssd3h we overbet the turn, but on 986fd8x we use 75%).\n \nI will let you define your own strategy here. If you think your opponents stab sufficiently when checked to OTF, we should use the overbet when they x/b. If you think they don't do this, then a 33% size is going to be preferred!\n \nPlease also note that when the flop goes x/x we still don't do too much delay cbetting in this spot.\n \n732r \u2013 it's tough to come up with a solid strategy because the solver loves to overbet here after flop goes x/x. I think we should stick with the above sizing scheme and use 125% on all low board pairing cards and 33% on middling cards/J+. If we want we can use a 75% size on the middling cards, but that's quite tough to remember because it involves using 3 sizes. Again, the solver is mixing between small and big (whilst marginally favouring big) so both options are fine, we just run into TP more often in reality than the solver does, and therefore we prefer to use a smaller size here. Note the solver folds 20% of the time on 732rQx but in reality people's folding ranges will be far greater.\n \nT54r \u2013 It's interesting that the solver likes to overbet the 2x/3x here but it doesn't on 986fd. I think we should stick with our 75% sizing scheme on undercards. We overbet the low board pairing cards, and we use 33% on essentially everything else. Again, the solver mixes between 33% and 125% on broadways, but as stated already a few times, 33% will work well here.\n \nThe strategy so far \u2013 overbet low board pairing cards, bet 33% on any flush completing cards/significant straight completing cards, bet 75% on bricky undercards and choose between 33% or 125% on broadways depending on what you want your own strategy to be.\n \nQ42r \u2013 If we follow the above paragraph and continue to implement this strategy, we overbet 2x/4x, we bet small on Kx/Ax, and we bet 75% on 6x-Qx. Really easy to follow/understand. Please also note that if we take J63r and 986fd and look at the betting frequencies, we'll note that despite being very different textures the trend is the same \u2013 the higher the card, the more frequently we bet. This is very consistent throughout the entire solver.\n \nJT9fd \u2013 this is identical to the MP strategy. When the flop is higher/super connected we always use 33% on the turn when we want to bet. QJ8fd is the same if we want a comparison (whilst it does prefer a bigger size on bricks for simplifcation we can just bet 33%).\n \nKJ3r \u2013 an identical strategy to MP on these types of boards. Given how wide we're supposed to bet the flop our range is weakend when we do x/b (note the difference in equity OTF compared to OTT). As ever we prefer to use the smaller size here. QT6fd plays slightly differently on the lower cards, but again we will still use 33% on these low cards.\n \nA83r \u2013 a really similar strategy to MP. We don't do too much stabbing at all, but when we do, we use the 33% size. Again, the higher the turn, the more frequently we stab.\n \nGeneral trends from x/x flop \u2013 bet small on straight/flush completing turns, and Q/K/A turns. Bet 75% on any brick turns, any middling/high board pairing cards. Bet 125% on low board pairing cards.\n \nGeneral trends \u2013 when the flop is broadway heavy OR A high we want to use a 33% turn probe on all the turns. Note that the higher the turn the more frequently we stab.\n \n \nWhen we x/r the flop\n \nThe solver is extremely consistent with MP's strategy. A quick summary of what that is...\n \nWe have two sizes, 33% and 100%. The 100% size is a compromise between 75% and 125%, and essentially allows us to play for stacks. We use 33% on any straight/flush completing cards.\n \nOn 732r we x/r a ton of broadway cards, so we want to use a 33% size on these broadway cards, but on 653fd type boards we don't xr KQhh anywhere near as much, so we prefer the pot sized bet.\n \nIn game, ask yourself \u201cdo I x/r this flop quite wide with my broadways?\u201d If the answer is yes, we can use a 33% size on the broadway turns. If the answer is no, we prefer to use a pot sized bet.\n \nIf the board is high/connected like JT9fd, KQ9fd etc, our x/r range is quite narrow, so our betting range OTT after x/r is small and therefore one size of pot is preferred.\n \nOn A high boards and single broadway boards, when we do x/r our opponent continues with quite a strong range. We start to check quite wide OTT so when we do bet we use the PSB.\n \n \nWhen we x/c the flop\n \nOur strategy is extremely similar to MP; we don't do very much check raising at all. We have some very infrequent sets that didn't x/r the flop, turned 2pairs and our strong draws/combo draws that we have turned. Again, we fold our underpairs/marginal holdings here.\n \nT62r is a perfect example of what our turn x/r range looks like. Also see 732r9c as well.\n \n \nWhen we bet flop and BTN calls\n \nA lot of the preset examples fall under the rule of \u201ccheck our entire range\u201d because they are T high and below. As mentioned in the 'CO vs BTN flop strategy' part of the module we do a lot more checking on A high flops, single broadway flops etc. This means that our range is narrower when we do bet the flop on these types of textures.\n \n \nGeneral A high strategy\n \nAs we can see when we look at A83r the solver consistently prefers the 33% size OTT after betting 33% OTF. Compare that to A43fd and we can see we clearly prefer a big bet OTT after a big bet OTF.\n \nSingle broadway flops.\n \nOur turn size is dependent on our flop strategy (similarly to MP strat). If we look at Q42r we can see that the solver does prefer a 75% flop size.\n \nIf we choose a 33% flop strategy, we only use 33% OTT.\n \nIf we choose a 75% flop strategy, we overbet brick turns and bet 75% on overcards.\n \nWe have to choose a strategy that suits us. If we think our opponents call correctly vs a 33% size, we should use 75%. If we think our opponents are folding more than the solver, we should use 75%. It's important to nail down that flop strategy because it significantly affects our turn strategy.\n \nKJ3r \u2013 similarly to MP vs BTN (and everything above), the trend still applies. We bet 33% OTF and we continue that with 33% OTT. Interestingly the solver bets quite wide here. We can also compare this to KJ4fd and QJ2fd and see that the solver is consistent, and on QJ2fd when we bet less frequently OTF (but still for the 33% sizing) we bet less frequently OTT (again still for that 33% sizing)\n \nWhen we bet a wide range OTF, we bet a wide range OTT. When we bet a narrow range OTF, we bet a narrow range OTT.\n \nGeneral monotone flop discussion\n \nThe solver does a little bit of cbetting flop on certain monotone boards MP vs BTN but the trend is that we never cbet monotone flops CO vs BTN, unless the board is two broadway disconnected. We'll see that AJ3sss and AQ2sss we want to bet sometimes, but KJ9sss, 962sss, J85sss etc we want to pure check. Please note that even on the flops we have a betting range on we're still not betting very wide at all!\n \nWhen the flop goes x/x we want to do a lot of checking again, but we actually stab the spade turns really wide. So 962sss when flop goes x/x we x a bunch on brick turns, but spade turns we want to stab with some of our airballs.\n \nSummary \u2013 bluff 4 card flush turns really wide!\n\n\nBTN vs MP turn strategy (IP)\n\n\nI'm going to construct this part of the module similarly to MP vs BTN. We're going to pick 8 flops and note the strategy on each way we get to the turn, and we'll use a couple of random flops here and there to prove the solver's consistency.\n\n\nAfter flop goes x/x and OOP x's again\n\n\n653fd/986fd \u2013 33% on straight and flush completing turns/broadways, 75% on anything else. We\ncan use 743r to see that already the solver is very consistent. Again note that we are supposed to stab flop relatively wide, and if we don't OOP is supposed to stab turn around 40ish%, so when it does go x/x x, we're not betting all that much, around 50% on the most frequently bet turn card.\n\n\nThe reason we want to stab broadways so wide for 33% is because OOP massively caps themselves when they x flop and x turn.\n\n\n732r \u2013 identical to above. Low cards, straight completing cards, board pairing cards it uses 33%. On middling 8/9/T cards it uses 75%, and on any J/Q/K it uses 33%.\n\n\nOn all the above 3 boards the solver uses small on J/Q/K but overbets the ace. This is because of just how infrequently we bet the ace, we're very polarised. Try and include it in your strategy if you can but if you want to simplify and bet 33% on all broadways that's fine too.\n\n\nT54r \u2013 this appears to be when the solver starts to play a little differently OTT. Again it's using 75% on bricks and 33% on board pairing/straight completing cards, but it likes to start to overbet the overcards. When we compare this to J83r and Q75r we can see that the solver is quite consistent.\n\n\nSummary \u2013 on low disconnected boards we do a lot of small betting, but when the highest card becomes a ten we start to overbet the overcards. We can define our own strategy here. T54r is a perfect example \u2013 on a 3 turn we are betting 33%, on a 9 turn we are betting 75%, on a K turn we are betting 133%. Do we want to ditch the 133% size and just use 75% on these overcard turns? I think that's the best idea, but if you feel confident having 3 sizes that's completely fine too.\n\n\nQ42 is identical to the above strategy. It does prefer a 33% size on some brick turns but we're going to simplify and use 75%.\n\n\nJT9fd \u2013 we're rarely betting the flop here, so when we do bet the turn, we use the 75% size (apart from straight completing cards where we use 33%). We can compare this strategy to QJ8fd to confirm the strategy is consistent.\n\n\nQuickly sidetracking and looking at double broadway flops in general, when we get to this part of the tree we see that we do a TON of checking back, and we can simplify our strategy to only use 75% when we bet. If we look at QJ2fd and KJ3r we can see that the solver is consistent.\n\n\nSummary \u2013 we do a ton of checking back OTT on the boards where the flop wasn't good for us OR when the turn brings double broadway, but when we do bet we can use one simple 75% sizing.\n\n\nA high boards \u2013 the solver is a bit all over the place here. We can determine that both 'double broadway boards' and 'ace high boards' are boards that we don't stab very often OTF/OTT so when we do want to stab OTT we can just use a 75% size. The solver agrees with that on double broadway boards but not necessarily ace high boards, but for simplification purposes we can class them as \u201cboards we aren't betting very often\u201d and use 75% when we do want to stab. This ties in nicely with the bolded section above in terms of simplifying our strategy to make it easier to follow!\n\n\n\n\nAfter flop goes x/x and OOP stabs\n\n\n653fd \u2013 our strategy is dependent on what size our opponent uses. As ever within the solver vs small bets we raise more frequently than we do vs big bets. Given we have a balanced x/b range that contains overpairs/NFDs our raising range is going to be really easy to work out. We don't raise too often but we raise overpairs sometimes, turned combo draws, turned 2p, turned sets etc. That's going to be a really consistent theme throughout.\n\n\n986fd \u2013 plays exactly as above.\n\n\n732r \u2013 plays as above. Note on the Th turn that we are raising 18.32% of the time but that is only 5 combos. This really drives home the fact that we are not raising very much at all overall here. Given how wide we should be stabbing OTF our range is quite narrow. Factor in a preferred larger size for OOP = an extremely tight raising range for IP.\n\n\nSimplification - having looked through the remainder of these textures (and similar ones for comparison) I can confidently state that our strategy is the same on all the different types of boards. When the flop goes x/x and villain stabs turn we raise our turned strong hands, some combo draws at some frequency, and any slowplayed sets OTF. The wetter the texture, the less frequently we raise. When our opponent chooses 75% or 133% OTT we are raising so infrequently compared to a 33% or 50% size.\n\n\n\n\nAfter villain x/c's flop\n\n\n653fd \u2013 When we get to the turn the bigger the card the more we overbet. We now use 75% on straight/flush completing cards/middling cards. The trend within the solver will be that on these really low boards we shouldn't overbet 8/9/T type turns, and it's not too difficult to remember that, so we should keep it in our strategy.\n\n\n986fd \u2013 it would appear that the solver is going to prove consistent with a strategy of using 75% on straight/flush completing cards and overbetting the low bricks/high cards. If we look at T92r we can see that the solver is really consistent here with it's overbetting, but prefers the 75% on the straight flush completing cards.\n\n\nPlease note that it appears we're still only betting around 50% of the time. The bigger we bet, the less frequently we bet.\n\n\nGeneral strategy so far \u2013 we are going to bet 125% on broadway overcards/bricks, and use 75% on straight/flush completing cards (apart from 4 card straight cards where we will use 33%). We can back this up by looking at 963r. On very low flops we want to bet 75% on middling turns instead of overbetting.\n\n\nT54r \u2013 T54 prefers a 75% size on undercards to the T and overbets on the overcards. J63r prefers an overbet on basically every turn. It's tough to define a strategy when the solver is preferring vastly different strategies on similar board textures. This is why we look for simplifcations.\n\n\nGeneral strategy \u2013 we want to bet 75% on straight/flush completing cards/board pairing cards/middling cards, and bet 125% on overcards (as mentioned we now have more overcards in our range than our opponent on a lot of textures (e.g. on 653dds our opponent folds KQhh but we have that in our stabbing range so on a Q turn we are doing better than you'd think)).\n\n\nIf we look at some double broadway boards/boards we are supposed to stab big on OTF/A high boards, we'll see that the strategy is different. On KQ2r we bet 125% on the bricks, and 75% on the straight completing cards. Even on A high boards like A83r we still prefer the overbet size. We should use the 125% on these double broadway flops/A high flops (even the A high flops where we bet 33%).\n\n\nWhat have we learned/why is the solver doing this? OTT we rarely play a small bet size IP (even when we're not the preflop aggressor). When our opponent x/c's he has very few airballs in his range and therefore we prefer the overbet size (and betting at a lower frequency).\n\n\nOverall summary of general strat \u2013 75% on straight/flush completing cards, overbet bricks and broadways (unless straight completing), and don't bet too much.\n\n\nAs ever, our turn betting range contains hands with equity and very very few airballs. OOP folds out all their trash and we can't just bet willy nilly.\n\n\n\n\nWhen villain cbets flop and cbets turn or checks turn\n\n\nOur strategy will be dependent on our opponent's sizing scheme. If OOP bets small OTF they should bet small OTT and we will have more raises. If OOP bets big OTF they should bet big OTT and we'll have less raises.\n\n\n653fd/986fd/JT9fd \u2013 villain in theory checks range OTF so n/a.\n\n\n732r \u2013 villain should do a lot of 75 OTF/75 OTT here so we'll play very few raises on these low textures. We raise any slowplays OTF/turned strong hands, and mix in some gutshots/turned FDs if we have them. When villain checks turn to us we probe a ton of our no equity airballs and we check back our marginal hands like A high and low PPs. If we look at how his equity changes when he checks the turn, this is the reason we can stab so wide.\n\n\nT54r \u2013 this is a perfect example of how much we should raise vs a small size. We have zero slowplays vs small/small so we raise any sets/2p/turned straights etc. As above if villain chooses a larger sizing scheme we don't raise as much with our more marginal holdings, but our sets become fastplays. A great example is on T43ssd8d we don't raise JJ vs a big turn bet, but vs a small turn bet we raise it much more frequently. Again when villain gives up OTT we start to stab quite wide.\n\n\nGeneral strategy \u2013 we have flop slowplays in our range because we are IP so our range can support raising turns (if we were OOP like BB vs BTN we have so few slowplays so it wouldn't make much sense to do so). Raise really wide vs small turn bets, not as wide vs the 75% and never vs the overbet. We are IP so the bigger the bet the less we raise because we can still make the pot bigger ourselves OTR when checked to.\n\n\nGeneral strategy \u2013 stab wide vs turn giveups! This can be proven in the drastic equity change in OOP's range when he checks turn.\n\n\nQ42r \u2013 this is the first spot where we do see overbets from OOP. As you can imagine, we just have zero raises vs overbet size. When checked to we can decide our own strategy here and we can use either 33% or 125% (the solver just never uses 75%). Alternatively a solid strategy is to bet small on lower turns and to overbet the bigger turns (note the difference between 8x and Kx. We bet these bigger turns less frequently. It makes sense for us to play like this because on Q425 we want to bet 88 etc at a decent frequency, but on Q42J we don't want to bet these middling PPs and therefore our range is more polarised.\n\n\nKJ3r \u2013 this is a spot where in theory OOP should go small/small. As above, we are doing more raising than you'd think, and that's because we have slowplays in our range. We want to start raising those flopped slowplays and our stronger TPs. When checked to it's interesting to see that the strategy changes and we only play big bets here. This is again because of how infrequently our middling PPs want to bet (thus making us polarised).\n\n\nGeneral strategy (and this is a great one) \u2013 when checked to OTT ask yourself \u201cdo my pocket 8s want to bet here?\u201d if the answer is \u201cyes/sometimes\u201d we choose 33%. If the answer is \u201cnot really/never\u201d we choose 125%.\n\n\nOn Q325 our 88 does want to bet. On Q32J it doesn't.\nOn KJ32 our 88 doesn't want to bet. On KJ3Q it doesn't want to bet.\n\n\nIf we force OOP to bet a board like 732r, even on big turns our 88 still wants to bet (because only one overcard) so we would still choose a 33% size.\n\n\nPlease note that on a board like QJ2fd the pocket 8s rule doesn't apply because we fold our 88 OTF. Given our range narrows significantly to stronger hands, we still want to bet the turn wide when checked to with these hands (perfect example of this is the difference between when OOP bets 33% and when he bets 75%).\n\n\nA83r \u2013 again the solver is really consistent with it's raising strategy/frequencies vs a small/small sizing scheme. We now start to bloat the pot with our slowplayed sets/turned straight draws etc. If our opponents bet 75% or overbet the turn (which they will make the mistake of doing) we continue with strong hands only and play no raises. Note that the solver only uses big bets when probing turn here. This makes sense on an A high board and ties in nicely with the above few examples (A83r and KJ2fd play the same turn probe size strategy). We aren't betting that often when checked to, so when we do, we use the overbet size. We can note the difference between A83r and AQ7fd and decide that we want to keep it simple and only overbet when checked to on A high boards.\n\n\n \nBTN vs CO turn strategy (IP)\n \nAgain, this section of the module won't be as long as the BTN vs MP section. We're looking to see if the strategy is the same/similar.\n \nAfter flop goes x/x and OOP x's again\n \n653fd \u2013 this is moot because we're supposed to stab SO wide OTF vs CO.\n \n986fd \u2013 75% on bricks, 33% on straight/flush completing cards (as before). The difference here is that BTN vs CO we want to use a larger size on the broadway cards (we were going 33% on broadways vs MP). We can use 33% on broadway cards and keep our strategy consistent with vs MP. It's tough to have different sizing schemes vs different positions. The difference will be that we want to stab less frequently on these turns because of how much more broadways our opponents open preflop.\n \nOur opponents won't check to us as much as they should with turned TPs so when they do they are relatively capped and using a small size on broadway turns makes our bluffs cheaper (whilst still being in line with the solver's strategy on many flops).\n \nGeneral notes \u2013 33% on straight/flush completing cards, 75% on low bricks and 33% on broadway cards.\n \nT54r/Q42r \u2013 identical to above. Again favouring the larger size on broadway turns, and this time we're going to stick with that; as mentioned because of the \u201cpocket 8s rule\u201d we want to use a larger size on the broadway cards because our middling hands don't want to bet as much. The difference here is that on both these boards there are 2 broadway cards on a big turn hence the bigger size preferred. Let's use 33% on the brick turns as the solver is really consistent with that.\n \nJT9fd \u2013 identical to MP (bet rarely and bet 75% apart from straight completing turns). QJ8fd is a relatively similar board and we can see the solver is checking back a ton but favours a bigger size when betting.\n \nKJ3r \u2013 annoyingly the solver favours an overbet here instead of the 75% size we saw vs MP. Let's keep to that strategy and bet infrequently. When we do bet we bet 75% (apart from Qx/Tx turns where we bet 33%). Note that we are stabbing more vs CO than we are vs MP; when they check twice they're just going to really struggle to continue. Equity OOP nosedives so drastically when they check twice!\n \nA83r/A94r \u2013 similar to vs MP the solver is a bit erratic here. As suggested, we want to just keep the strategy the same and just stab marginally wider.\n \nGeneral strategy \u2013 when checked to twice on double broadway turns/A high turns we bet really wide!\n \nGeneral notes \u2013 we're playing a very similar strategy, we just stab more often because when OOP checks twice their equity can't handle the pressure we can apply on their range.\n \n \nAfter flop goes x/x and OOP stabs\n \nT high boards and below \u2013 let's summarise these boards together for simplicity. Again we do a ton of stabbing on these low boards OTF (653fd for example we stab everything). This means that we don't often get to the turn this way, but if we do our range is relatively narrow.\n \nThere are some boards that we do have a small-ish xb range on, and that means we have some slowplays OTF, some airball xbs etc. Again our strategy is dependent on villain's turn size. If they bet big we rarely raise and if they bet small our raises are these slowplays. We can use 963rTd to see that even vs a 33% turn stab we are raising 27% of the time, but that's 4.3 combos (!!!!).\n \nSummary \u2013 we stab so wide on T high flops that we don't really need to look at these. On the boards that we do x/b approx 35% on, we have raises vs smaller sizes and a lot less raises vs larger sizes. It's very easy to see what these raises are.\n \nThis is the simplification given in the BTN vs MP part of the module...\n \n\u201cSimplification - having looked through the remainder of these textures (and similar ones for comparison) I can confidently state that our strategy is the same on all the different types of boards. When the flop goes x/x and villain stabs turn we raise our turned strong hands, some combo draws at some frequency, and any slowplayed sets OTF. The wetter the texture, the less frequently we raise. When our opponent chooses 75% or 125% OTT we are raising so infrequently compared to a 33% or 50% size.\u201d\n \nSummary \u2013 stab really wide vs CO on T high flops (the lower the better)! When it's a board we're not stabbing relentlessly like KJ3r or A97r we have some slowplays in our range which means we can raise turn probes with these strong hands and any high equity bluffs. The bigger the size, the less we raise (we basically never raise an overbet), and the smaller the size, the more frequently we raise!\n \n \nAfter villain xc's flop\n \nThe first thing we need to note is that vs MP we're only barreling around 50% of the time OTT. Vs CO the general consensus is that we barrel the lower cards at a much higher frequency, and bet the broadway cards the same amount. So if the flop is low and we stab really wide, we continue to barrel OTT more than we do vs MP on the lower cards.\n \nThe strategy is identical to the BTN vs MP part of the module. Quick recap \u2013 we use 33% on straight/flush completing cards, we use 75% on board pairing cards and middling cards (middling cards only applies to the low flops) and we use 125% on broadways (we're supposed to use 75% vs CO but let's keep it simple and overbet these broadway cards like we would vs MP). Interesting to note that we can overbet broadways when not the preflop aggressor but in a situation like BTN vs BB when we are the preflop aggressor we don't do any overbetting.\n \nThe only time we have a small bet after a big flop bet is on a low flush completing card (but that isze is still 75%  and not 33%). Even on straight completing turns if we bet big OTF we bet big OTT. QJ8fd is a perfect example of our sizing scheme.\n \nWhen villain cbets flop and cbets turn or checks turn\n \nT high flops\n \nWe shouldn't face any cbets OTF in these spots, but I wanted to point out the below...\n \nAs mentioned above our opponents will not follow the theory correctly and they will play some bets on some flops they shouldn't. It's tough for us to study this vs CO as the OOP player is supposed to check a ton. If we do face flop bets when we shouldn't we should treat it as if we were vs MP and play the same (i.e. some flop floats, a decent amount of raises with obvious hands). This means that we play the turn the same as we would vs MP. We have some slowplays in our range, we have some turned strong hands, and we have some high equity bluffs, so we can raise turn bets. The frequency we raise depends on the bet size.\n \nIf we do face a cbet on these flops and villain checks the turn to us we can see on T92r that we have a small probe size on low turns and a big probe size on big turns. Think \u201cpocket 8s rule\u201d.\n \nNon T high flops\n \nThese are spots where we ARE supposed to face cbets OTF. We know that on boards like Q42, J76 etc we are supposed to face less cbets OTF, so let's look at some boards where villain is supposed to cbet.\n \nKJ3r \u2013 as mentioned in the CO vs BTN section we can see that in theory OOP is supposed to bet 33% OTF and 33% again OTT. Nobody is doing this so as mentioned many times our raising frequencies are determined by our opponent's turn size. Again we have some flopped slowplays and some turned equity bluffs. Again, when checked to we play big bets only. Our betting range is really narrow and the pocket 8s rule applies so we prefer a larger size. Again we can see on A72r when checked to OTT we play a big sizing only.\n \nThere's a huge difference between the way we play A72r and K32r OTT with these middling hands. We rarely probe turn on A72r with our middling PPs/marginal hands but we probe really wide on K32r. I believe this is because 1) we want to protect from Ax rivers and 2) we can bluff wide with our one-overcard flop floats on K32r but obviously there is no such hand on A72r.\n \nGeneral strategy \u2013 people will over c-bet these flops CO vs BTN, so we need to have some slowplayed hands in our calling range. BTN vs MP these are low frequency sets but as we've seen we raise these almost always vs CO, so our slowplays become top-pair-good-kicker type hands. If we don't we can't raise our combo draws etc OTT. On T high flops and below when probing turn use a small size on bricks and a big size on big cards.  On boards with 2 high cards use a big size only when p robing. Note how much we should be checking back!\nHand Histories (WITH SOME MULTIWAYS!!!):\n\n\n(0:46) vs Co Gazzy has 7\u26637\u2660 on the BTN \nFlop: 8\u26666\u26602\u2665 (8.5 BB). Co checks. Gazzy bets 33% and CO calls .\nGood flop check by CO. On boards T-high or below CO should basically check his entire range.Btn in this position should use a 33% stab size with a fairly wide range. \nTurn: 2\u2663 (14 BB). Both players check\nBtn on this turn should mainly be betting a polarized range using a larger bet-sizing strategy\nRiver: 7\u2666 (14 BB). Co bets ~75% pot. Gazzy raises 3x. Co shoves and Gazzy calls. CO wins with 8\u26658\u2660\n(6:13) Gazzy has Q\u2665K\u2665 in MP vs Btn \nFlop: K\u2660Q\u26634\u2666 (6.5 BB). Gazzy bets 33% and Btn calls.\nThis is a good flop for mp and in this spot we should be betting about 75% of the time. Hands with no equity like 76 or A6 no bdfd make up the bulk of our checking range.\nTurn: 7\u2663 (10.5 BB). Gazzy bets 125% pot and Btn calls.\nGazzy points out that this overbet is a mistake and solver prefers to bet small again on the turn as MP.\nRiver: T\u2666 (40 BB). Gazzy bets ~75% pot. Btn calls and wins with 7\u26657\u2660\nTo recap, Gazzy prefers to use a small single-sizing strategy on flop and turn, but on some rivers he likes to split his range into 2-size (big/small bet) strategy. A river T is a better board for a single-sizing strategy.\n(13:30) Vs MP Gazzy has  K\u2666Q\u2666 on the Btn \nFlop: 6\u26653\u26633\u2665 (6 BB). MP bets 75%. Gazzy calls.\nGood sizing by MP. As Btn solver calls with KQ bdfd half the time. However, this is a marginal call and Gazzy prefers to just fold in-game. Against a smaller sizing this combo is definitely a call. \nTurn: K\u2663 (14.5 BB). MP bets ~75%. Gazzy calls.\nThis is a good card for MP\u2019s range that he should be barrelling at a high frequency. Gazzy has an easy turn call going into the river. \nRiver: 4\u2666 (40 BB). MP bets ~75% pot. Gazzy calls and wins against  Q\u2663J\u2663\nWell played by both players here. MP should bet this river with a wide range of bluffs. \n(18:20) Multiway Hand: Gazzy is in the Co with  A\u26637\u2663 vs Btn and BB \nFlop: K\u26652\u2663T\u2666 (8 BB). All players check.\nHeads-up this is a really good flop for CO\u2019s range and solver suggests betting really wide.In multiway pots Gazzy recommends generally betting 50% pot with a narrower range. This hand isn\u2019t strong enough to bet in this case.\nTurn: 6\u2663 (8 BB). BB bets ~33% pot. Gazzy raises 3x. Btn folds and BB calls\nRiver: 2\u2665 (26 BB). Gazzy bets ~120% pot. BB calls and wins with 6\u26656\u2666\nOn this river Gazzy thinks it\u2019s best to mostly overbet using a polarized range. It\u2019s not ideal to have flush blockers, but there aren\u2019t enough natural bluffs Gazzy can have to not overbet here.\n(29:35) Multiway: Gazzy is in the Co with  6\u26606\u2665 vs Btn and BB\nFlop: 7\u26655\u26663\u2666 (8 BB). Gazzy bets 50% pot. Btn calls and BB folds.\n(Gazzy prefaces the action stating that he \u201cabsolutely butchered\u201d this hand)  \nVs Btn solver recommends checking 100% of the time on this board. Gazzy thinks CO might want to have some bluffs here multiway, however, betting 66 here is still an obvious mistake.\nTurn: 2\u2660 (16 BB). Gazzy checks. Btn bets ~pot. Gazzy calls\nNo way to put it other than this is a disaster of a turn call. \nRiver: 6\u2666 (45 BB). Both players check and Gazzy wins against 8\u26668\u2663\nGazzy prefers Btn bet 75% on the turn rather than pot, but otherwise well played.\n(32:00) Vs Co Gazzy has K\u2663J\u2663 on the Btn\nFlop: 2\u26663\u2666K\u2665 (6 BB). Co checks. Gazzy bets 66%. Co calls. \nCo should bet fairly often here using a 33% pot sizing strategy. Gazzy would have preferred to have seen himself bet 33% pot here rather than 66%. \nTurn: 4\u2663 (16 BB). Co checks. Gazzy bets 75% pot. Co calls. \nOn this turn the solver checks more than half the time while using a strictly overbet sizing when betting. This KJ combo with a fd overbets ~80% of the time while all other KJ combos mostly check.\nRiver: 7\u2660 (38 BB). Both players check. Gazzy wins against A\u2666Q\u2666\n(38:00) Vs MP Gazzy has Q\u2665 J\u2665 on the Btn\nFlop: 9\u26607\u2665J\u2663 (4.5 BB). MP checks. Gazzy bets 33% pot. MP calls\nThis is one of the boards where MP will need to check upwards of 75% of the time. When MP does bet he should stick to a smaller sizing. Btn should stick to stabbing with a 33% sizing when checked to. This QJ combos mixes between stabbing and checking back\nTurn: 7\u2666 (9 BB). Both players check. \nQJ makes a good check on the flop because it\u2019s Btn\u2019s weakest top pair. The same logic largely applies to this turn \nRiver: 4\u2660 (9 BB). MP checks. Gazzy bets 75%. MP calls and loses with A\u26656\u2665\n(43:10) Multiway: Gazzy has J\u26608\u2660 in MP vs Btn and BB\nFlop: 2\u2663Q\u26602\u2666 (8 BB). All players check\nGazzy\u2019s hand doesn\u2019t have enough equity to bet here.Hands like KJ or JTss make up the bottom of MP\u2019s betting range in this spot multiway. \nTurn: 4\u2663 (8 BB). Gazzy bets 75% pot. Btn calls and BB folds \nMP\u2019s prefer bet sizing in this spot is 75% pot. J8 no fd should still check but Ax wheel draw combos and other turned draws make for good bluffing candidates in this spot. Gazzy notes that this bet was another big mistake.\nRiver: K\u2666 (19.5 BB). Gazzy bets 75% pot. Btn folds.\nArriving at the river this way, Gazzy thinks he is pretty much forced to bet here. The solver likely prefers different sizings based on the runout, but in this case 75% pot makes the most sense. On cards like a 5 the solver is going to want to incorporate some overbets with a more polarized range.\n(47:10) Multiway: Gazzy has Q\u2660Q\u2665 in Co vs Btn and BB\nFlop: 8\u2665T\u2665K\u2663 (8 BB).

Weak and inexperienced players tend to call raises with the same range of hands, regardless of size (known as a \u2018static\u2019 calling range).\nIf the weak player will call with the same range of hands versus a 3.5bb raise as they would versus a 2.5bb raise, you should opt for the former because it will allow you to win more money (on average).\nbb = big blinds\n________________\n\n\nRule #2: 3-bet larger preflop when you will be out of position postflop.\nYou should 3-bet around three times your opponent\u2019s raise size when you are in position and around four times your opponent\u2019s raise size when you are out of position\nWhen you are out of position, your opponent will realize his equity much more easily, which means you should size up your 3-bets. By contrast, you generally want to use a smaller 3-bet sizes in position because you want to put your opponent in a tough spot (facing a well-sized 3-bet out of position) with his medium strength hands.\n________________\n\n\nRule #3: Bet small (25-35% pot) on dry, static board textures\nAs well as functioning to get value, bets on the flop and turn deny your opponents their equity when they fold. In other words, you take away their chance of winning the pot by forcing them to fold with a bet.\nWhen equity denial is not important, you are more incentivized to use small bet sizes. This is often the case on dry boards because most of your opponent\u2019s hands will have little-to-no equity against your value betting range.\nAnother benefit of using a small bet size on dry boards is that calling ranges tend to be inelastic. Phrased differently: the likelihood that your opponent folds to a bet will be similar regardless of bet size. Why risk betting large with your bluffs when you can get the same result with a smaller bet?\nAdditionally, small bet sizes work well as an exploitative adjustment against players that fold too often. This is particularly true in live games and weak online environments where many opponents often play a \u2018fit or fold\u2019 postflop style.\nHere\u2019s a hand played by an Upswing Lab member that demonstrates this concept:\nOnline Cash 6-Handed. 100bb Effective Stacks.\nHero is dealt 6\u2666 5\u2666 in the CO.\nUTG folds. MP folds. Hero raises to 2.5bb. BTN folds. SB folds. BB calls.\nFlop (5.5bb): A\u2666 8\u2660 3\u2663\nBB checks. Hero bets 1.8bb. BB folds.\nAnalysis from Doug\nOn a dry board like A\u2666 8\u2660 3\u2663, a small bet size (33% in this example) makes the most sense. This is because our range of value hands (88, 33, A8s, A3s, AK, AQ, etc) is unlikely to be outdrawn on the turn, so we aren\u2019t as incentivized to drive out our opponent\u2019s equity with a larger bet.\nIn the equity calculation below, we can see just how little equity the BB\u2019s range has versus our value betting range:\n bet size poker equity \n\nThe BB\u2019s estimated range has just 11.32% equity\nAnd this chart shows how much equity each hand in the BB\u2019s range has versus our value betting range (does not include our bluffs):\n bet size range breakdown \n\nThe overwhelming majority of the BB\u2019s range poses very little threat to our value bets\nAlso, the BB\u2019s calling range is likely to be inelastic in this spot. Hands like QJo and 65s will usually be folded regardless of the bet size because such hands have terrible playability on later streets. Not to mention they are drawing nearly dead against our value hands.\n________________\n\n\nRule #4: Bet pretty large (55-80% pot) on wet, dynamic board textures\nWhen your value betting range is vulnerable to being outdrawn, you should use a larger bet size. This strategy has three notable benefits:\n1. Large bet sizes allow you to build the pot when you have a strong hand.\n2. Larger bets extract more value before the turn or river has a chance to reduce your strong hand to a bluff-catcher.\nFor instance, almost half of the deck is a bad card for 9\u2663 9\u2666 on T\u2665 9\u2665 5\u2660 4\u2660.\n3. Large bet sizes generate more fold equity, making your bluffs more effective\nFor example, this hand was played by John C. and analyzed by Doug in the private Upswing Lab group:\nOnline Cash 6-Handed. 100bb Effective Stacks.\nHero is dealt A\u2663 A\u2665 on the BTN.\nUTG raises to 3bb. MP calls. CO folds. Hero raises to 11bb. SB folds. BB folds. UTG calls. MP calls.\nFlop (34.5bb): 2\u2660 5\u2665 3\u2660\nUTG checks. MP checks. Hero bets 12bb. UTG calls. MP calls.\nTurn (70.5bb): 8\u2663\nUTG checks. MP checks. Hero bets 22.32bb. UTG folds. MP calls.\nRiver (115.14bb): 6\u2665\nMP checks. Hero\u2026?\nAnalysis from Doug\nThis ~33% flop bet size is too small given the board texture and stack-to-pot ratio. The board is low, but it is not static \u2013 our opponents can have a variety of flush draws and backdoor draws.\nOur stack depth is another reason to large bet on this flop. If we bet 22bb (65% pot-size bet) and get called by one player, we will take a turn card with 78.5bb in the pot and 67bb behind. This stack-to-pot ratio allows us to comfortably shove on the turn (more on this in rule #5).\nWhen we use a flop bet size that allows us to go all-in on the turn, our bluffs will generate more fold equity and our opponents won\u2019t have a great price to draw.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that checking on this flop would also be a reasonable play with aces.\n________________\n\n\nRule #5: The stack-to-pot ratio should influence your bet size\nYour stack-to-pot ratio (SPR) is an important factor to consider when choosing a bet size.\nYou have to think ahead, considering what the size of the pot will be on later streets and how you intend to proceed with your value hands and bluffs.\nMany players will bet too large on the flop and turn, and as a result end up with a tiny bet left behind on the river. Bluffing is extremely ineffective in such situations because tiny river shoves generate little-to-no fold equity, which is not a desirable situation.\nThis example hand was played and submitted by Upswing Lab member Bogdan E.:\n150/300 Live Tournament 9-Handed. 21,000 Effective Stacks.\nHero is dealt Q\u2665 Q\u2666 on the BTN.\nUTG calls. UTG+1 calls. LJ calls. HJ folds. CO folds. Hero raises to 1,200. SB folds. BB calls. UTG+1 calls. LJ calls.\nFlop (5,250): 3\u2660 6\u2663 9\u2665\nBB checks. UTG+1 checks. LJ checks. Hero bets 3,000. BB folds. UTG+1 calls. LJ folds.\nTurn (11,250): J\u2666\nUTG+1 checks. Hero bets 7,000. UTG+1 raises to 15,000. Hero raises to 16,800 and is all-in. UTG+1 calls and shows 6d6h.\nRiver (44,850): 5\u2663\nAnalysis from Doug\nThe first sizing error in this hand is the preflop raise \u2014 somewhere between 1,800 and 2,000 chips would have been better. With three limpers already in the pot, we need to raise to a size that doesn\u2019t give our opponents such a good price to call.\nRaising to a bigger size is particularly important with the hand we have, QQ, since high pocket pairs perform better with a low SPR and when fewer players see the flop.\nAssuming we make it 1,800 and get the same number of callers, the pot on the flop will be 7,650 with 19,200 behind. Considering our SPR, using a size of around 5,000 (~65% pot) on the flop sets us up nicely for a shove on the turn \u2014 14,200 into 17,650 assuming one caller (~80% pot).\nThis approach allows us to extract maximum value with our strong hands whilst ensuring we generate good fold equity with our bluffs (like QTs).\nThe larger sizes Bogdan actually used on the flop and turn will often times lead to an awkward spot on the river. Had our opponent not check-raised on the turn, we would have reached the river with less than a half-pot size bet behind (~10,000 into ~25,000) which is not ideal for our triple-barrel bluffs.\n________________\n\n\nRule #6: Overbet when you have a nut advantage\nOverbets work well on boards that favor your range over your opponent\u2019s range, particularly when only you are able to have the stongest hands.\nAn overbetting range should also be polarized, made up of only strong hands and bluffs. Using such a large size allows you to get the maximum with your value hands, and generate maximum fold equity with our bluffs.\nThe most effective overbet bluffs are usually hands that block our opponent\u2019s most likely strong hands that will call. The best example of this is using the nut flush blocker on a three-to-a-flush board (think A\u2666 K\u2660 on Q\u2666 8\u2666 2\u2663 6\u2666 3\u2660).\nThis hand was played by Doug and self-analyzed in his overbet module in the Upswing Lab:\n$100/$200 Heads-Up. $59,416 Effective Stacks.\nDoug is dealt 4\u2666 2\u2666 in the BB.\nBTN raises to $700. Doug calls.\nFlop ($1,400): 5\u2660 A\u2665 Q\u2666\nDoug checks. BTN bets $980. Doug calls.\nTurn ($3,360): 3\u2663\nDoug checks. BTN checks.\nRiver ($3,360): 7\u2666\nDoug checks. BTN bets $1,500. Doug raises to $10,800. BTN calls and mucks A\u2660 2\u2665.\nAnalysis from Doug\nWe can make some assumptions about the button\u2019s range once he checks the turn:\n   1. The button does not have the turned nuts (42) because that hand would almost certainly value bet on the turn.\n   2. The button does not have the rivered nuts (64) because a 6-high draw would almost certainly semi-bluff on the turn.\n   3. The sets and two pairs in the button\u2019s preflop range (AA, QQ, 55, AQ, A5) are unlikely to have been played this way.\nSince our opponent is very unlikely to have a nutted hand on this river, we can construct an overbetting strategy. Here is how we will divvy up our value range on the river:\nCheck-raise huge with our strongest hands (64, 42, 55, 33)\nOverbet check-raising here allows us to extract an extra bet from our opponent\u2019s bluffs, and get maximum value when our opponent bets-calls with a value hand (like the A2o here).\nWe also need to mix in some bluff check-raises here in order to balance out our value bets. 54 is a perfect candidate because it blocks set combos (55), two-pair combos (A5, Q5, 53) and straight combos (42 and 64).\nThe size of our check-raise in this spot should always be large (at least 2x pot) because we are representing a polarized range.\nOverbet lead with the rest of our value hands (35, A5, A3, A7, some Ax)\nWe can then overbet lead with our medium-to-strong hands, which prevents our opponent from checking back for free on the river.\n________________\n\n\nRule #7: Bet at least 66% pot on the turn when firing the second continuation bet\nThe most important concept to keep in mind for playing on the turn is polarization. You want your betting range to be comprised of hands that will be able to value bet on the river very often and hands that have a decent chance to improve to the best hand on the river.\nMiddling hands, which are typically included in small betting ranges, should be checked for the following reasons:\n   * If the turn checks through, middling hands will be strong enough to bet on the river for value.\n   * You can use middling hands to catch your opponent\u2019s bluffs on the river.\n   * Middling hands protect the weak showdown value hands (such as A/K-high) with which you would also check.\n   * Including middling hands in your turn checking range will allow you to credibly bluff with very weak hands on the river.\nThis way, all your hands work symbiotically to maximize the expected value (EV) of your whole strategy.\nBecause you are using a polarized strategy, your bet size should be bigger in order to extract maximum value with your strong hands and to increase the frequency at which you can bluff. Using anything less than 66% in the vast majority of cases will just lower your overall EV.\n________________\n\n\nRule #8: You should usually c-bet between 25-40% of the pot in 3-bet pots\nThis is tied to rule #5.\nBecause the stack-to-pot ratio is so low in 3-bet pots, you can put all your stack in on the river with under pot sized bets, even if you start with a very low c-bet size. Furthermore, this bet size is also the one that solvers prefers both in position and out of position.\nGiven the ranges involved a small bet usually puts enough pressure on the middling part of your villain\u2019s hands (make him have a hard time with them).\nShould You Ever Bluff with a Pair?\n Should You Ever Bluff with a Pair? \n\nTurning a made hand into a bluff might initially sound counterintuitive. In the pre-solver days, holding a weak pair was often associated with checking, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to bloat the pot and are happy to reach a cheap showdown\u201d was a common saying. Solvers helped us understand that betting weak pairs outperforms checking in some situations. The line between randomly betting pairs and precisely knowing what you are doing can be blurry. But fear not! In this article, you will learn everything you need to successfully grasp the concepts of bluffing pairs in cash games to outplay your opponents.\nThe Logic Behind Turning Pairs \u2192 Bluffs\nBefore diving into the practical examples, we need to know a few theoretical things.\nWhen we look at solver outputs on the river, we frequently see that we are not just bluffing our air but are also supposed to use some of our pairs. The solver calculates:\n   * The EV of pure bluffing: EV (Bluff) = (Fold% \u00d7 (Pot)) \u2013 (Defend% \u00d7 (Bet))\n   * The EV of checking as the IP player: (EQ of hand) \u00d7 (Pot)\n(OOP is slightly more complicated because we are not closing the action.)\nThe calculated EV helps us to understand how all of the possible actions perform on the river.\n gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 1 gto \n\nOn earlier streets, however, multiple merged motives can sometimes encourage us to take the aggressive line with some of our weak pairs.\nTo clarify, a solver does not \u201cthink\u201d as a human would; it\u2019s an EV-maximizing algorithm that calculates the best strategies given the inputs that were provided. By comparing solver outputs, we can recognize repeating patterns for which we can build heur\u00edstics that make all of this output easier to understand and more practical to use in-game.\nThe Dos and Don\u2019ts\nTurning pairs into a bluff can be tricky. Often, minor differences draw the line between an excellent play and a spew. But there is good news! This is not just solver noise. Every strange-looking play is made for a reason. The more we understand how ranges interact with board textures and potential runouts, the easier it becomes. To uncover the different motives for sometimes taking the aggressive route with our weak pairs and acquire the ability to spot the difference between randomly clicking buttons and thoughtful plays, we will inspect some realistic examples to better grasp when and why to turn pairs into bluffs.\nBluffing Pairs in Single-Raised Pots\nWe usually want to keep the pot small with marginal holdings, especially when we are out of position (OOP). There are situations, though, where we want to check/raise some of our weak pairs. To give you a better insight, let us explore the following spot:\n gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 2 \n\nBB response (filtered for suited 4-x) vs BTN\u2019s 33% pot c-bet on K84r: NL500, 100bb starting\nAs we can see, our bottom pairs, especially the ones with the lowest kickers, get checked/raised around 20% of the time here. But why is that? Let\u2019s take a closer look at the BTN response to find out:\n gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 3 \n\nBTN response vs BB\u2019s 100% pot check/raise\nThere are a couple of prominent indicators to be identified in the BTN\u2019s response:\n      * The BTN is starting to fold better pairs, such as 55\u201377, some 8-x, and even a tiny percentage of their weakest top pairs. IP is folding a massive number of two live overcards to the four, which results in an immense amount of EQ denial. At the same time, the BTN is floating with their best backdoor hands. So, the effect is of a merged nature; we get some better hands to fold and a few worse hands to call (or fold).\n      * The BB blocks a decent amount of IP\u2019s best hands when holding a four while having five outs to outdraw their higher pairs.\n      * IP is folding a lot of Ten-x, Jack-x, and Queen-x, so OOP prefers to check/raise 4-x that unblock those hands by not holding one of these three cards. Hands like Q4 block more of IP\u2019s folding range than hands like 43. Another motive is the risk of coolers for OOP increases when holding Q4 instead of 43. IP has significantly more KQ and QQ combos they continue with compared to 33 and K3 because IP doesn\u2019t have any K3o in his range and folds all 33 combos versus the check/raise.\n      * In this situation, one exception is low pairs with an overcard to the top pair, A4. A4 benefits from check/raising since it can outdraw current nutted two pairs and cooler Ace-x when an Ace turns up.\nGetting a clearer picture of how to play the flop is already great, but future streets are often still shrouded in a fog of war. Countless different runouts can make it feel complicated to locate the signal of when and why to keep betting our weak pairs. Let us examine how and how not to keep betting our weakest pairs on future runouts together.\nWhen To Keep Bluffing With Pairs\n gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 4 \n\n\u2191 BB turn strategy (filtered for 4-x) vs BTN on K842r (after flop = X-B33-R100-C)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u2193 BTN response vs BB\u2019s 125% pot turn barrel\n gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 5 \n\nWe take a turn onto a bricky 2. The sim tells us to keep the pressure on with almost 80% of BB\u2019s 4-x. Some motives are pretty similar to the flop, but a few differ.\n      * The first two reasons overlap with the ones on the flop: The BTN folds many better pairs:\n\u2022\nAll pocket pairs below the King fold purely.\n\u2022\nThe vast majority of second pairs (68.4%), and even a considerable number of top pairs (34.9%). (BB also denies a significant amount of EQ from all BTN\u2019s flop floats that are now pure folding on the turn.)\n      * The noticeable difference is that the BB is running out of bluffs. All the BDSD and BDFD combos between the 8 and the King are giving up pure because of poor blocker properties and no chance to improve to even outdraw a top pair King. The BB\u2019s 4-x combos are getting forced into becoming bluffs. The fact that the BTN doesn\u2019t continue with worse hands, except for a minimal amount of gutshots around the low end of the board, is also an indication that they\u2019re now considered bluffs. Third pair (4-x) is now betting for less merged motives; they become almost pure polar bluffs.\nThe river doesn\u2019t change much on almost all runouts, except for the worst ones (King and 8); the BB is turning a substantial amount of 4-x into bluffs.\n gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 6 \n\nBB first-in river strategy (filter: 4-x) vs BTN on K842r 2 (after flop = X-B33-R100-C, turn = B125-C)\nWhile the BB\u2019s reasons for check/raising some of their small pairs started out merged on the flop, the motives cleared up as the hand progressed through the streets to the river. Blocking a substantial amount of BTN\u00b4s strong hands and running out of natural bluffs while at the bottom of their range are the leading drivers for the BB to complete the conversion of 4-x into a bluff on the river in this spot.\nWhen To Stop Bluffing With Pairs\nIn some scenarios, we don\u2019t want to follow through with our weak pairs. To gain a more detailed understanding, let\u2019s explore the following spot.\n gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 7 \n\nBB first-in river strategy (filter: 4-x) vs BTN on K8422 double FD brick (after flop = X-B33-R100-C, turn = B125-C)\nDid you notice a difference regarding the board texture from the prior spot? At first, it seems there is only a small one, right? The suits changed, but that\u00b4s about it. The strategy for OOP\u2019s 4-x massively differs, though.\nAll of BB\u2019s 4-x is now pure checking the river. Let us find out why!\n      * We see something worth noticing if we examine the EQ of BB\u2019s 4-x on the river. They have roughly twice the amount of EQ compared to the spot before. The reason is pretty simple: The BTN has lots of bricked flush draws. So, the BB can beat some of villain\u2019s range at showdown with all their 4-x. OOP collects enough EV (i.e., showdown value) to make check the max EV action.\n      * The BTN has a lot of bricked flush draws, but so does the BB, right? In the spot prior, the BB was running out of natural bluffs and was at the bottom of range when holding a single pair of fours. The BB can now choose bluffs from all their bricked flush draws they check/raised and barreled turn with.\nTo summarize the key learning so far:\nThere are sometimes merged motives for betting low pairs on the flop and turn, despite having enough showdown value and other bluffs to choose from.\nThe main merged motives for low pairs are:\n      * Folding out better hands (pairs).\n      * Denying EQ while getting called by worse hands (draws).\nThose merge-bets with low pairs happen even more frequently when in position because the IP player can realize more EQ by always being able to check back the river on runouts where they don\u2019t need to turn their weak pairs into a bluff.\nAs we can see, minor differences in board texture can cause major differences in strategy. Keeping an eye on how ranges look across all streets will help you maneuver through these spots more efficiently.\nBluffing Pairs in 3-Bet Pots\nTurning pairs into a bluff is not just happening in SRPs. Let us explore the following two spots together to help you understand when and when not to bluff pairs in 3-bet pots!\nWhen To Bluff With Pairs\n gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 8 \n\nBTN river strategy vs CO on AK48T (with flop = X-B33-C, turn = X-B75-C): NL500, 100bb starting)\nWhen we examine the river output more closely, we will instantly notice that the BTN is bluffing with a decent amount of third and worse pairs (roughly 62%). There are a few reasons:\n      * BTN\u2019s lowest pairs have almost no showdown value.\n      * Hands such as JT and QT have good removal effects since they don\u2019t block any snap-folds and also block rivered two pairs the CO is pure calling the river with. Even though they win more at showdown compared to the lowest pocket pairs, it\u2019s only by a marginal amount\u2014they only have 5\u20137% EQ themselves.\n      * IP is running out of natural bluffs. Hands such as QJ/QT and JT that were gutshots on the turn rivered a straight or a pair. There are only very few busted draws in the BTN\u2019s range. In particular, the lowest pairs with pure unblocker properties are now forced to turn themselves into a bluff. When we modify the river to a brick (that doesn\u2019t change the nuts) like a deuce, we see that most of the BTN\u2019s low pairs are checking back.\n      * Ranges become very tight on the river. Blocker effects matter way more now. Having removal of a couple of strong hands in villain\u2019s range already or blocking some of the snap-folds already has an enormous impact on their calling/folding ranges. A hand such as Q\u26669\u2666 gives up pure while QT is bluffing pure, even though Q9 has less showdown value (roughly 5% less EQ). Q9 in diamonds blocks several snap-folds while JT has removal to a bunch of strong hands.\nNotice that the same reasons to bluff low pairs return:\n      * The low pairs are weak, they have low showdown value.\n      * Favorable blocker effects.\n      * The player runs out of natural bluffs.\nBefore we explore when not to bluff pairs in 3-bet pots, let\u2019s test our understanding of ranges and how this impacts our strategy!\n gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 9 \n\nThe EV of all given options to the BTN for JTs on the river\nQuestion: J\u2660T\u2660 makes more money than J\u2665T\u2665 and even more than double the amount of J\u2666T\u2666 for the shoving option. Why is that?\nReveal Answer\nYou can use this knowledge to your advantage. In spots where you suspect that your opponent will call slightly lighter than he is supposed to, we can simplify and purely give up with our worst-performing pairs that are indifferent at equilibrium.\nWhen you struggle with finding the motives why a particular combo gets chosen over another for a particular action, a closer look at the following two things will help you.\n      * Exploring the trash and value removal scores at the top left of each combo.\n      * Examine your opponent\u2019s response versus your strategy.\nWhen Not To Bluff With Pairs\n gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 10 \n\nBTN river strategy vs CO on JT523 (with flop = X-B33-C, turn = X-B75-C): NL500, 100bb starting)\nWhen we compare the previous spot with this one, we will spot a big difference regarding the bluffing combos: The BTN is not bluffing with a single pair on the river, but why?\n      * Even the worst pairs, such as A3s have almost 16% EQ, way more than the worst pairs in the spot before. The CO has a lot of bricked draws in range, enough that even the worst pairs in CO\u2019s range win more than 15% of the time.\n      * The BTN is not running out of natural bluffs. IP has plenty of combos with acceptable or good blocker properties, such as all busted straight draws and Ace-highs, except those with spades. All of them have much worse showdown value compared to the low pairs.\nIn spots where a player has lots of natural bluffs with good blocker properties and very little showdown value to choose from on the river, they often won\u2019t need to turn weak pairs into a bluff.\nThe Influence of Position\nPositions play a prominent role in how you construct your strategy. Let\u2019s jump into the following spot to understand more deeply what influence positions have on bluffing pairs.\n gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 11 \n\n\u2191 BTN river strategy (filter: low pair) vs BB on JT36A flush-completing in an SRP (with flop = X-B50-C, turn = X-X)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u2193 UTG river strategy (filter: low pair) vs BB (same board (runout) and action)\n gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 12 \n\nBoth spots are very similar, with the same flop sizing and turn check, on the same board. The only visible difference is the position. The IP player in the left picture opened from UTG, and the IP player on the right opened from the BTN. When we note the worst pairs of the IP player, we notice that the BTN checks them 100% of the time, while the UTG player turns them into a bluff almost 40% of the time. There are the following reasons:\n      * The BB\u2019s postflop defense is much wider versus the BTN compared to the one versus UTG. This means the lowest pairs of the BTN have way more EQ and showdown value compared to UTG. Looking at the EQ of the weakest pairs in both outputs confirms that. All pocket 99 and lower pairs of UTG have 0% EQ, while those same hands of BTN retain between 8\u201325% EQ.\n      * The postflop defending ranges differ greatly depending on the position, but so do the preflop opening ranges. While the UTG player lacks a lot of natural bluffs in his range, such as all the seven to King-high combos, the BTN has far more natural bluffs to choose from.\nAs we can see, position is a very influential factor in the process of answering the questions of when and why to bluff pairs. In the end, though, it all comes down to how well you understand the composition of ranges and their interaction with board textures. Constantly improving this skill will help you to outperform and outplay your opponents in the long run.\nWhen We Want to Deviate\nAgainst weaker opponents who deviate themselves (often unintentionally), we want to adjust our strategy as well\u2014from the default, GTO game plan to a custom-tailored, exploitative one. To illustrate how to adapt when it comes to turning pairs into bluffs, let us do a little experiment and take the previous BB vs BTN spot on JT36A flush-completing river but with a little twist.\nIn theory, the BB can only fold slightly over 50% of their third and worse pairs against a 67% pot river-bet in this spot.\nNow, let us imagine we play at our local casino and face a tighter player who folds all their third pairs and worse on the river. How do we want to adjust?\n gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 13 \n\n\u2191 BTN GTO river strategy (filter: low pair) vs BB on JT36A flush-completing river in an SRP (with flop = X-B50-C, turn = X-X): equilibrium\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u2193 BTN exploitative river strategy (filter: low pair) vs BB (same board (runout), same action): nodelocked BB response (folding 100% of all third pairs and worse)\n gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 14 \n\n      * When we look at our default (GTO) strategy, we see that all low pairs always check on the river. They have enough showdown value, and the BTN has so much air to choose from that we don\u2019t even consider bluffing them. They are \u201ctoo high up in our range.\u201d\n      * Even though the above reasons also apply, when we examine the nodelocked (exploitative) solution, we notice a massive difference. The BTN is turning 100% of their low pairs into bluffs. Comparing the EV of BTN\u2019s low pairs shows us how drastic the impact of BB\u2019s heavy over-folding is:\n gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 15 \n\n gto wizard bluffing pairs in cash games image 16 \n\nThe EV of all given options to the BTN for 55 on the river: GTO (\u2196), Exploitative (\u2197)\nDepending on the combo, the EV of bluffing for all low pairs increases between 250 and even over 400%. An outcome like this is not even unrealistic when we face a very tight player. As we can see, turning pairs into a bluff that would usually always take a showdown can be highly profitable. Keeping an eye on the player type you are facing, understanding what you and your opponent are supposed to do, and being able to adjust accordingly will skyrocket your win rate.\nConclusion\nUff, this was a lot of information to process! Let us go over the most critical points again.\n      * While the motive for betting low pairs on the river is primarily driven by folding out better ones, betting low pairs on earlier streets often involves merged motives. The main reasons are to fold out better made hands and deny EQ while getting called by worse hands (typically draws). Merged betting with low pairs happens more often when we are IP due to higher EQR.\n      * In river spots where we have many natural bluffs with good blocker properties and very little showdown value to choose from, turning our low pairs into a bluff is often overkill.\n      * Don\u2019t gloss over seemingly small differences in board texture. They can significantly impact optimal strategies.\n      * When you are not sure why a particular combo gets chosen over another, inspect the trash and value removal scores at the top-left of each hand combination and how your opponent will respond versus your strategy. It will help you to maneuver through the hands more confidently.\n      * Understanding the composition of ranges and their interaction with board textures is the key to outplaying your opponents in the long run.\n      * Adapting to the mistakes of our opposing players will make the difference between being a slight or massive winner.\nDo you want to learn more about strategy with pairs? Then, this excellent article on check/raising a single pair will probably be interesting to you.\nWe\u2019re At The River. Our Hand Can\u2019t Win. Now What?\n We\u2019re At The River. Our Hand Can\u2019t Win. Now What? \n\nYou\u2019re in a heads-up pot and you\u2019ve made it to the river. Your opponent has check/called two streets, so you\u2019re relatively confident their range is at least somewhat capped. There\u2019s just one problem; you have a really weak hand that can\u2019t win the pot without bluffing.\nHow do you figure out whether you should bluff or give up, when you have no information about how your opponent plays?\nWhile this can be a very tricky spot to navigate, especially in larger pots, there are plenty of theoretical concepts we can call upon to help us with this kind of decision. Let\u2019s explore a few of the most important things we should be keeping in mind when we arrive at the river with a potential bluffing candidate.\nTheoretical concerns:\n      * Showdown value\n      * Blockers\n      * Unblockers\n      * Frequencies\n Multiway strategy in Progressive Knockout Tournaments \n\nShowdown Value\nFirst and foremost, we have to evaluate whether the idea that our hand can\u2019t win at showdown is actually accurate. After all, there are plenty of scenarios where a hand that was bluffing on one or even both previous streets still has 5%, 10%, or even 20% equity once the river rolls off.\nExample\nTake this spot as an example\u2014it\u2019s based on a recent online hand I played. It\u2019s an MTT spot where we open A\u2666K\u2660 from the LJ at an 8-handed table and get called by the SB, with effective stacks of roughly 30bb. I\u2019ve used Chip EV ranges here, just to illustrate the principles at work.\nThe flop comes T43 with two clubs, villain checks, we c-bet 40% pot, and villain calls. The turn is an offsuit Queen, villain checks, and we bet again for a roughly geometric size of around 70% pot. villain calls, and the river comes an offsuit 7.\n We\u2019re At The River. Our Hand Can\u2019t Win. Now What? \n\nThe postflop action\nWe could think about bluffing here, given that we only have Ace-high, and we can put a lot of pressure on a hand like JTs or T9s, which would be a pure bluff-catcher here. However, before we bluff with this hand (and remember, in theory, bluffing the river is usually a 0EV proposition unless we have some very important blockers), we should make sure to evaluate whether it\u2019s possible we can actually win at showdown because:\nIf we know that checking makes money, then making a theoretically break-even bluff on the river is actually a bad play.\n We\u2019re At The River. Our Hand Can\u2019t Win. Now What? \n\nLJ\u2019s river strategy with AKo vs SB\nAs you can see here, any combo of AKo that reaches the river in this line wins 21%\u201330% of the pot by checking, given that we beat all of villain\u2019s missed flush draws and combo draws. So, even though bluff-shoving would be winning around 15% of the pot at the bare minimum here, that\u2019s not enough to justify actually making the play.\nIf we\u2019re going to make sure we have enough bluffs here to keep villain indifferent, which is what we should be doing in theory, then there\u2019s no reason to take a hand that can sometimes win at showdown and use it as a bluff. We may as well use hands that never win at showdown instead, and this way we\u2019re not giving up whatever percentage of the pot we might be winning if we check.\n We\u2019re At The River. Our Hand Can\u2019t Win. Now What? \n\nLJ\u2019s river strategy with 98s vs SB\nBy contrast, here\u2019s a look at the EV of betting vs checking when we have 98s\u2014clearly, this is a big difference. While minor card removal factors related to the turn being the Q\u2665 do make 9\u26668\u2666 a better bluff than 9\u26658\u2665 here, we\u2019re bluffing 9\u26658\u2665 100% of the time, even though it\u2019s only winning 8.6% of the pot by doing so. This is specifically because we\u2019re only making 2% of the pot if we check since it\u2019s so difficult for the villain to ever have worse than 9-high.\nOf course, there are plenty of spots where even Ace-high has no showdown value at all, based on the nature of the board texture and the opponent\u2019s range for continuing beyond the turn; in those spots, bluffing the river with Ace-high will usually be a much more reasonable proposition. But you\u2019d be surprised how many errors players will make by bluffing with hands that simply don\u2019t need to bluff in order to sometimes be able to win.\nBlockers and Unblockers\nA lot is made of the significance of blockers within poker strategy, and in many cases, they\u2019re not as meaningful as you might think, but bluffing the river is one instance where it is important to be mindful of each individual hand\u2019s blocking and unblocking properties.\nAs a rule of thumb, if we\u2019re planning to bluff the river, we want our hand to do two things:\n      * Block at least some of the hands our opponent is likely to call with\n      * Unblock as many folding hands as possible, or in other words, not blocking any of the folding range\nWhile it\u2019s not easy to find spots where a hand does both of these, it does occur surprisingly often, and these are spots where we should make sure we pull the trigger on bluffs.\nThere are also plenty of spots where our hand will be able to do one of the above, but not the other, and bluffing with these hands is generally going to be pretty reasonable as well.\nThe spots we want to avoid, however, are the ones where our hand does neither of the two things we want\u2014it doesn\u2019t block any calling hands, and it actually does block some of our opponent\u2019s folding range.\nIn these spots, our bluff is significantly less likely to get through. The best way to explore these spots with GTO Wizard is by using the \u201cBlockers\u201d tab in the analysis section of a sim. The first clues can be found in the \u201cHands\u201d tab however. Let\u2019s go back to our previous example so I can show you what I mean.\n We\u2019re At The River. Our Hand Can\u2019t Win. Now What? \n\nLJ\u2019s river strategy with AKo vs SB\nHere are all of our AKo combos from the spot we were looking at before. The blocker scores are represented in the top-left of each rectangle, next to the hands themselves. The left number is the value removal, while the right one is the trash removal.\nValue Removal Score\nWhen using these scores to guide us, it\u2019s important to note that since value removal only really refers to the top portion of our opponent\u2019s range and not their bluff-catchers, most of our bluffing candidates in many spots will have relatively low value removal scores. Even a 2 or a 3 can be a significant factor in some scenarios. All the AKo combos have a 1 in this particular spot because they don\u2019t block any two pairs, sets, or straights.\nTrash Removal Score\nHowever, the trash removal scores are going to vary significantly, depending on certain hands\u2019 interaction with all the weakest combos in our opponent\u2019s range. In this particular spot, a combo like A\u2666K\u2660 doesn\u2019t block any of the weakest hands in villain\u2019s range, which are mostly missed flush draws, so it has a 1 for trash removal; something like A\u2663K\u2665, though, has a 6 for trash removal, because the A\u2663 blocks all the missed nut flush draws.\nWhen In-Game\nWe can\u2019t necessarily expect ourselves to calculate these removal scores in a precise way in-game, but looking at the scores in the sims we study away from the tables helps us to acknowledge why a certain hand might be choosing whether or not to bluff in a specific spot. This process cultivates the intuition that we rely upon when sitting at a table where it\u2019s brain vs brain.\nFrequencies\nOur final theoretical concern in these spots is our overall bluffing frequency. While we won\u2019t always be up against opponents who are capable of recognizing whether we\u2019re over-bluffing or under-bluffing, we do have to be mindful of:\n      * The information we convey to everyone else at the table when hands go to showdown.\n      * The way our bluffing choices on the river will affect the way our opponents perceive us over time.\nIf we automatically bluff the river with every possible bluffing candidate, we\u2019re likely going to end up over-bluffing, which may actually be a short-term benefit in many spots, but could leave us open to a very obvious counterexploit by any competent and attentive opponent at the table\u2014they simply stop folding their bluff-catchers. Conversely, if we don\u2019t bluff the river even with our best candidates, those competent opponents can make the inverse adjustment relatively easily; folding to our river-bets more often.\nWhile it might be tempting to dive down the rabbit hole of deliberately trying to influence our opponents\u2019 future adaptations with our current actions, it\u2019s a very difficult dynamic to navigate; we can\u2019t always be particularly confident of the exact adaptations our opponents will make, or when those adaptations will occur. The way we extract ourselves from this complicated leveling war is by ensuring that we don\u2019t overly commit to over-bluffing or under-bluffing exploitatively until we have a high level of confidence in our opponent\u2019s tendencies. And the way we do that is by having a baseline notion of what our give-up hands are in any given spot, using the principles we\u2019ve already discussed.\n How Accurate Are GTO Wizard's Solutions? \n\nIf we arrive at the river with a poor bluffing candidate\u2014which blocks some of our opponent\u2019s folding range, doesn\u2019t block any of their calling range, and/or has some showdown value\u2014checking is likely to be a very good option.\nBut what happens when we\u2019re simply not sure whether our hand has the right properties or not? After all, some spots are very complex.\nWell, ultimately, if we want to moderate the frequencies in a way that makes sense, we can usually default to one simple protocol:\nThe hands with the least showdown value are more likely to want to bluff.\nIf we have a choice between bluffing the river with Ace-high or 9-high, and we\u2019re not sure which of the two has the right blocking and unblocking properties, we would prefer to bluff the 9-high and check the Ace-high, simply because we can be more confident that we\u2019re not wasting any showdown value.\nConclusion\nIn short, we can follow one fairly simple maxim:\nIf you arrive at the river and can\u2019t easily identify any better bluffing candidates or weaker showdown value hands in your range than your current hand, your current hand will probably serve decently well as a bluff.\nThis will help you moderate your bluffing frequencies to some degree and make it less likely you\u2019re going to end up with literally no bluffs at all in any specific scenario.\nHopefully, this article has given you a sense of how to make your decisions in these spots with no information about your opponent \u2013 I\u2019ll be following this one up with an article about exploitative bluffing choices against opponents whose weaknesses we know fairly well, so look out for that one further down the line.\nWhen Is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know\n When Is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know \n\nWhen is bluffing profitable? When you expect your opponent to fold!\nThat\u2019s not a joke, and I don\u2019t say that only because it isn\u2019t funny. When playing against weaker players, you may be able to anticipate that they will fold, or at least that they are likely to defend at lower than the optimal frequency necessary to make your bluffs unprofitable. Bluffing is not generally very profitable, so exploiting opponents who over-fold really is where much of your profit from bluffing will come from. That is not the subject of this article, however.\nWhat Is a Bluff?\nDefining a bluff is trickier than you might think. Broadly, it could mean any bet where you are rooting for your opponent to fold, or at least rooting for them to fold hands better than yours. For our purposes, I want to be a bit more specific:\nA bluff is a bet that derives most or all of its value from fold equity.\nThat means little to none of the bet\u2019s value derives from pots won at showdown, whether that be winning unimproved or improving to something that can win at showdown.\n      * On the river, it\u2019s easy to meet this definition. You can\u2019t improve your hand if your bluff doesn\u2019t work, nor should you expect your opponent to call with a hand even weaker than your own in hopes of improving it.\n      * Before the river, however, pure bluffs are rare. Most hands have some chance of improving, even if it\u2019s just a backdoor draw or a miracle two-outer.\nWhen I talk about bluffing before the river, I mean betting the worst hands in your range, even if they are not completely hopeless.\nBluffing in the AKQ Game\nPerhaps you\u2019ve heard of the \u201cAKQ Game\u201d (sometimes called the \u201cClairvoyance Game\u201d). In this toy game, both players are dealt a single card from a deck containing one Ace, one King, and\u010d one Queen. They ante and are allowed to bet as they could in a real poker game. If the hand goes to showdown, the player with the highest card wins.\nSuppose you were dealt a Queen in this game. Your opponent checks, and you are last to act. Should you bet?\nReveal Answer\nReal poker is more complicated. There are many cases where betting your worst hands should show a profit, and there are also many cases where you should expect it to be downright unprofitable, so it is not something you do at any frequency.\nWhether or not betting your worst hands should show a profit is mostly determined by what happened on earlier streets.\nA River Example\nBTN opens 2.5bb in a 100bb cash game and BB calls. On a flop of A\u2660T\u26663\u2666, BB checks and calls a 125% pot continuation bet. The 3\u2660 checks through, and the river brings the Q\u2665.\nThis is the Manhattan plot for BB\u2019s equilibrium river strategy with their entire range, weakest hands on the left and strongest hands on the right. I\u2019ve removed the bet sizes, so the chart simply shows how often BB bets each part of their range, without regard to size:\n When is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know \n\nBB river-probe strategy vs BTN on A\u2660T\u26663\u2666 3\u2660 Q\u2665 (with flop = X-B125-C)\nThe pure pink on the far left side of the graph means BB always bets their worst hands, stuff like 5\u26602\u2660, which whiffed on the gutshot and backdoor flush draw. These bets must, therefore, be profitable. If BB were indifferent to bluffing, as they are in the Clairvoyance Game, we would expect to see a mix of bets and checks. Here\u2019s the same plot in the Clairvoyance Game:\n When is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know \n\nBB river strategy vs BTN on 33322: Clairvoyance Game\nBecause BB only bets two hands in the Clairvoyance Game, this graph is easy to interpret. They always bet Aces, and they are indifferent to betting Queens.\nThat\u2019s not what we see in our river example.\nSo the question is, why is it profitable for BB to bet their worst hands in this equilibrium? Why doesn\u2019t BTN call more often in order to make BB indifferent to bluffing?\nChoose the explanation you think is correct from the four options below, then read on for the answer.\n      * BB has a reputation for being a nit, so BTN is trying to exploit them by not paying off their river-bets.\n      * BTN does not have enough potential bluff-catchers to hit MDF, which would make BB indifferent to bluffing.\n      * BB does not have enough potential bluffs to achieve the bluffing frequency that would incentivize BTN to bluff-catch more than they already are.\n      * BB\u2019s bluffs are carefully chosen for their blocker effects. When BB has these cards, they block BTN from having as many bluff-catchers as they otherwise would.\nReveal\nWhere Range Advantage Comes From\nBB gets profitable bluffs in this scenario because their range is much stronger than BTN\u2019s. They have more than 70% of the equity, a dynamic illustrated dramatically by this range-vs-range equity graph:\n When is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know \n\nRiver equity distributions\nSo much of BTN\u2019s range is behind so much of BB\u2019s range that if they called more often, in the hope of picking off bluffs from those very worst hands, BB could exploit them with thinner value-bets.\nBut that still doesn\u2019t get to the why. Why is BB\u2019s range so much stronger? Why isn\u2019t either player incentivized to do something differently on an earlier street to even out this dynamic?\nBB\u2019s Perspective\nPerhaps you noticed that I pulled a fast one a few paragraphs back when I said, \u201cIt seems like calling 5\u26602\u2660 [on the flop] is a win-win: either you improve to something strong, or you bluff and show a (small) profit.\u201d In fact, there is a third thing that could happen\u2014an event which quite frequently will happen, in fact\u2014that is not so good for 5\u26602\u2660 and which is the reason it is not a pure call on the flop: BTN might bet again on the turn, charging BB a high price to realize their equity on the river and denying them the opportunity to bluff.\nThe reason this dynamic can exist at equilibrium is that BB does not know, at the time they call the flop, that BTN is going to check behind the turn. If they knew that in advance, then they would call many more weak hands on the flop. But if they were to call more weak hands, then BTN could exploit them by barreling more often.\nBB took a big risk with those weak calls, and they got lucky that BTN didn\u2019t have a good barreling hand.\nThese profitable river bluffs are their reward for taking a risk that panned out.\nBTN\u2019s Perspective\nBTN, on the other hand, took a risk that did not pay off. They bet the flop, and their opponent did not fold. Of course, not all of BTN\u2019s range wants to see a fold, but much of it\u2014especially much of the range that isn\u2019t going to bet again on the turn\u2014would very much prefer to see BB fold the flop.\nBTN\u2019s flop-bet was not nearly as risky as BB\u2019s flop-call. They put the same amount of money into the pot, of course, but BTN had two big advantages going for them:\n      * They had fold equity. When BTN bets weak hands, they might just win the pot immediately, whereas BB can\u2019t win the pot immediately when they call. BB will sometimes get fold equity on the river after the turn checks through, and that does offset the risk of the flop-call, but they can\u2019t count on that happening consistently.\n      * Even in case their opponent did not fold, they were in position, giving them better control of the pot. They will be able to check behind the turn when they want to, facilitating free cards and cheaper showdowns.\nRange advantage emerges when players take on disproportionate risk at an earlier decision point.\nSo, when a player fades their worst-case outcomes, they typically have an equity advantage and get to make profitable (as opposed to break-even) bluffs with their weakest hands.\nThe reverse is also true:\nA player who takes on less risk on early streets is typically at an equity disadvantage on later streets and does not bet their worst hands at all.\nFor example, here is BTN\u2019s strategy for the same scenario, facing a BB river check:\n When is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know \n\nBTN river strategy vs BTN check on A\u2660T\u26663\u2666 3\u2660 Q\u2665 (with flop = X-B125-C, turn = X-X)\nWith their very worst hand, 6\u26605\u2660, they never bluff. Many other hands with 0% equity are also pure checks, suggesting they would be -EV bluffs. There are no pure bluffs, and the weak hands that mix bluffs are facilitated by blockers, not by an equity advantage.\nA Flop Example\nIf we back up to the flop in our example, the roles are reversed. BTN took on more risk preflop, so they are the player who sees the flop with a stronger range (55% equity) and the player who can profitably bet their worst hands. 65 without a backdoor flush draw is the stone bottom of BTN\u2019s range, yet even this hand has an EV of greater than 1bb (roughly 20% of the pot) and is a candidate for betting:\n When is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know \n\nBB has no donk-bets on this flop, and were they to face even a small c-bet, they would purely fold many of their worst hands:\n When is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know \n\nBB flop strategy vs BTN\u2019s 33% pot bet on AT3tt\nBecause of their range disadvantage (and, to a lesser extent, their positional disadvantage), they cannot profitably bluff with the bottom of their range as BTN can. It\u2019s not even a mix for them, as it would be in the Clairvoyance Game. Bluffing with their worst hands would lose money, on average.\nBut let\u2019s get back to BTN\u2019s strategy. In the Clairvoyance Game, a mix of bets and checks meant that bluffing was not profitable. In our river example, BB purely bet their worst hands because it was profitable. But in this flop example, BTN sometimes declines profitable bluffs.\nIf you\u2019re holding 6-high, no draw, and someone told you that you could claim 20% of the pot with a bluff, that would sound awfully appealing. Why would BTN ever decline to bluff and check such a weak hand instead?\nThe Bluffing Voucher\nThe way I think about this is that when a player fades a risk and arrives at a lucky branch of the game tree, they receive a voucher that can be redeemed for one profitable bluff. That is their reward for the risk they took. Unless some new bit of bad luck comes along, they can cash in that voucher at any time. But they only get to use it once.\n When is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know \n\nBB had to redeem their voucher in our river example because that was their last (reliable) opportunity to do so. They can\u2019t count on check/raising the river, because that would require their opponent\u2019s cooperation, and they should not expect BTN to bet many of the hands they would like to fold out with a bluff.\nA Turn Example\nIf both players check the A\u2660T\u26663\u2666 flop, BB would still be at an equity disadvantage. So, it would still be unprofitable for them to bluff their worst hands (unless they had especially good blockers):\n When is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know \n\nBB turn-probe strategy vs BTN on A\u2660T\u26663\u2666 3\u2660\nBTN, however, has not yet redeemed their voucher, so they once again have the option to bluff profitably with their worst hands. It is not their last opportunity, however, so they can just as profitably check and save that voucher for the river.\n When is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know \n\nA Different River Example\nIf both players check again on the turn, BB finally gets some break-even and/or profitable (with the help of blockers) bluffs on the river.\n When is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know \n\nBB river strategy vs BTN (with flop and turn = X-X)\nThe operating principle here is similar to our original river example, though the effect is less dramatic. BTN checking behind both the flop and turn was a stroke of good fortune for BB. BB would have called with more weak hands preflop if they knew they would get to see five cards for no additional investment, but of course, they did not know that. They went down a lucky branch of the game tree, and their reward was an upgrade from -EV to 0EV bluffs with the bottom of their range.\nAs for BTN, this is their last opportunity to redeem that voucher, so if BB checks, all their worst hands are pure bluffs:\n When is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know \n\nBTN double-delayed c-bet river strategy vs BB check\nVoiding the Voucher\nWhat if BB does not check the river? If BB bets, BTN\u2019s voucher is null and void. They mix some bluffs with their worst hands, but none of them are profitable (if they were, BTN would never fold them).\n When is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know \n\nBTN river strategy vs BB\u2019s 36% pot bet\nThe bluffing voucher is a lucky reward for fading risk and ending up on a favorable branch of the game tree. If BB bets either the turn or river, that is an unlucky occurrence for the BTN. It is not necessarily a strong hand, but it represents more strength than a check would have, which is why BTN loses their voucher.\nThey could also lose their voucher in an especially unfortunate event (i.e., flop, turn, or river). That is more rare, however. By definition, a range that is favored before new card(s) are dealt will generally remain favored after the card(s) are dealt. A player\u2019s previous-street equity, in other words, is the average of their equity on all possible runouts. So, it is only the most exceptionally bad turn cards that will disrupt their advantage.\nWhy Doesn\u2019t BB Beat BTN to the Punch?\nWe\u2019ve seen several examples where BTN gets profitable bluffs if BB checks but not if BB bets. If it\u2019s that easy to void BTN\u2019s bluffing voucher, why doesn\u2019t BB do it more often? Why not take the initiative and bluff first, pushing BTN off the weak hands, which will eventually bluff out BB\u2019s weak hands if given the opportunity?\nThey could, and sometimes they do, but it\u2019s risky. When a player with a range advantage checks, there\u2019s still a lot of strength in that checking range. Unless the new card is especially unlucky for BTN, it shouldn\u2019t be profitable for BB to bet any two cards. Yes, BB could sometimes steal the pot from a weak hand that would have stolen it from them if they\u2019d checked, but more often, they would get called or raised.\nThis risk is what makes BB\u2019s bets strong, alarming, unlucky actions that disrupt BTN\u2019s range advantage.\nWhen a player fades risk whilst having prepared for it, they are supposed to get a reward. That\u2019s what maintains the equilibrium.\nWhen you are in the BTN\u2019s shoes, it may feel bad to check the flop with a weak hand that could have profitably bluffed just to end up folding it to a turn-bet. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that that turn-bet was far from a guarantee.\nIn fact, another way of looking at this outcome is that you saved money by not bluffing into a hand that wasn\u2019t going to fold.\nThis is how BTN ends up indifferent between bluffing the flop versus checking the flop in hopes of bluffing later. There are risks to passing up the immediately profitable bluff: they might get an unlucky turn or induce BB to bluff with a hand that would have folded. But there are also rewards: they might get a lucky turn or find out cheaply that their bluff was never going to succeed.\n When Is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know \n\nConclusion\nA player acquires range advantage by taking on more risk than their opponent and then fading the worst outcomes (both unlucky board cards and unlucky opponent actions). They retain that range advantage until one of three things happens:\n      * They cash it in by betting. Betting with range advantage claims a lot of EV from the branch of the game tree where your opponent folds. If they don\u2019t fold, that is an unlucky outcome that strengthens their range (because calling and raising are risky), and you will generally be at a disadvantage going forward.\n      * An especially unlucky board card(s) disrupts their advantage.\n      * Their opponent takes a strong action that disrupts their advantage.\nWhile a player has the range advantage, they essentially have a voucher that entitles them to a single profitable (+EV) bluff with even their worst hands. They can use that immediately to bluff or check and (usually) carry their range advantage forward to the next street and bluff then.\nFor the player without a range advantage, it is usually -EV to bet their worst hands. These players may still bet hands that prefer to get folds, but these will either have especially good blockers or be closer to semi-bluffs, hands with a decent chance of winning when called.\nOnly when neither player has much of an advantage, as in the Clairvoyant Game, is betting the bottom of the range 0EV for both players.\nBlockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\nBlocker/unblocker was a concept my coach, Dara O\u2019Kearney, showed me in relation to bluffs. It is one of those things that you cannot unsee once you have been shown it. It applies to pre- and postflop, and it really helps you identify good bluffs when you\u2019re in the midst of a hand.\nA good bluff should simultaneously block very strong hands and unblock the hands that we want to fold out. Blocker/unblocker is a useful heuristic for picking powerful bluffs. It is particularly pertinent preflop and on the river.\nPreflop\nLet\u2019s jump right into a hand example to see what blocker/unblocker is.\nCash Game Hand Example\nThis is the NL500 opening range for UTG:\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\nUTG(6) opening strategy: 100bb, NL500\nIn response to the open, this is what the HJ strategy looks like at equilibrium:\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\nHJ response vs UTG(6) open\nIt\u2019s a pure raising range, of which about half the hands UTG opened.\nWhich ones of these hands would you consider to be bluffs?\nWe can answer that by looking at the UTG response to the HJ 3-bet:\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\nUTG(6) response vs HJ 3-bet\nA5s\u2013A3s are clearly bluffs; they can make better hands fold like A9s\u2013A6s and some small pocket pairs. KQo is also a bluff; similarly, it can get folds from some Ace-x and small pairs. However, these hands also make worse hands fold, but we are happy enough to take down the pot this way (especially to avoid paying rake postflop).\nThese might seem like quite strong hands to turn into bluffs. One of the reasons they are so effective is that:\nThey simultaneously block and unblock the right hands.\nA5s, for example, blocks the really strong hands like AA and AK. It also unblocks a lot of weaker (but still threatening) hands that fold like K9s\u2013K5s, QTs\u2013Q8s, and so on. So, just to be crystal clear, the Ace is a blocker, and the 5 is an unblocker.\nTournament Hand Example\nLet\u2019s look at a spot where preflop action is more significant, and taking the pot down then and there is very valuable, i.e., in tournaments. These are 20bb symmetrical stacks near the bubble. This is the CO opening range:\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\nCO opening strategy: 20bb (symmetric), near bubble\nThis is how the BTN responds:\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\nBTN response vs CO open\nA lot of folding, not much calling, and an almost 50/50 mix of shoving and raising to 5bb (with slightly more shoving).\nThis is the CO response to the 5bb raise:\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\nCO response vs BTN non-all-in (5bb) raise\nThis is the CO response to the all-in (20bb) raise:\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\nCO response vs BTN all-in (20bb) raise\nLooking at the folds, we can tell the primary bluffs are, once again, low suited Ace-x. They block the stronger Ace-x continues, while also unblocking all the suited Broadway hands that fold. There are some suited Broadway bluff-shoves like KQs\u2013KTs. They block many of the calling hands, such as KK, QQ, AK, AQ, JJ, and TT, but also unblock folding hands like the small pocket pairs, as well as Ace-x. We also see a small amount of bluff-raising with hands like K3s, which block KK/AK calls and unblock a lot of the suited Q-x and J-x hands that fold.\nNotice that we do not see bluffs with hands like J3s. And it so happens to be that they mostly go against the blocker/unblocker heuristic:\n      * By not blocking enough (only JJ in this spot) of the strong calling hands\n      * And not unblocking enough of the sort of hands that we\u2019d like to get folds from\nThere is another reason why we mostly pick suited hands like A5s and K3s for our bluffs. They block strong hands, they unblock folds, and crucially, they can make very strong hands when called. A hand like A5s or K3s is in bad shape when it is called by AA, KK, or AK, but it still has a little bit of extra chance of outdrawing via a flush by the river. The low cards in the bluffs are also at least \u2018live\u2019 in the sense that they have some outdraw possibilities by making a low straight or trips, which the AA and KK-type hands cannot.\nThis is why A5\u2013A2s make particularly strong bluffs. They block continues, they unblock \u2018discontinues,\u2019 they make (nut) flushes, and they make (wheel) straights.\nPostflop\nLet\u2019s look at this concept in a postflop scenario. This hand is on the river of an NL500 cash game. UTG has opened, and the BB has called.\n      * The flop is A\u26609\u26606\u2665.\n      * The flop has gone check, bet 33% pot, call.\n      * The turn is a 5\u2665.\n      * It goes check, bet 75% pot, call.\n      * The river is a 2\u2666.\nThese are the ranges for both players on the river with their equities:\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\nRiver ranges on A\u26609\u26606\u2665 5\u2665 2\u2666 (view: equity)\nUTG has all the nutted (90%+ equity) hands, but the BB has a lot of strong (70\u201390% EQ) hands they will want to get value with by betting them, which means they will also need some bluffs.\nWith that in mind, this is the BB\u2019s first action on the river:\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\nBB first-in river strategy\nMostly checks, but ~5% of the time, the BB leads. They have straights, two pairs, and top pairs that all want to extract value and do not want UTG to check back.\nThat means they also need some bluffs. Given that ~48% of hands in the range are under 50% equity and 14% of the range is considered \u2018trash,\u2019 the BB has plenty of options for the bluffs.\nLooking at the flop, my initial instinct regarding bluffs would be to prefer 8-x and 7-x because they block straights. I\u2019d be avoiding bluffing spade or heart draws that missed, because I know that missed flush draws often make bad bluffs because they block other missed flush draws that would make up a big part of the folding range. I\u2019d probably pick K8s, even though the only available combo is spades, because it blocks straights, AK, KK, and K9.\nHowever, the actual commonly used bluff hands here are all suited misses! 8\u26604\u2660 and 7\u26603\u2660 are pure bluffs. 7\u26604\u2660, J\u26608\u2660, T\u26658\u2665 and T\u26657\u2665 are frequent bluffs.\nThe fact that they have the suits from the missed flush draws is probably because there were two flush draws by the turn, and any hand with diamonds or clubs will have gotten out of the way already. So, the heuristic of missed flush draws being bad bluffs is not disproven, but here, we don\u2019t have many alternatives to choose from.\nEvery hand has an 8 or 7, which obviously blocks the straight. Let\u2019s look at the response to the 35% pot river donk-bet to learn more about the unblocker properties of our bluffs:\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\nUTG response vs BB\u2019s 35% pot river donk-bet\nUTG folds ~30% of the time. The hands that fold are predominantly Broadway hands that had a flush draw as well! Hands like K\u2660Q\u2660, K\u2660J\u2660, K\u2665J\u2665, K\u2660T\u2660, K\u2665T\u2665, K\u26608\u2660, K\u26607\u2660, Q\u2660J\u2660, Q\u2660T\u2660, Q\u2665T\u2665, JTs and some offsuit hands like KQo, KJo, KTo, QTo etc. There are other hands that fold, but most of the folds are unpaired hands with a King or Queen in them.\nAll of our primary bluffs unblock those hands. A hand like 8\u26604\u2660 blocks the nut straight and also unblocks all of those Broadway folds. This is not a high-adrenaline bluff that would make a TV highlight reel by getting a monster to fold; it\u2019s merely targeting all the trash in the range. Hands that would all check back if it was checked to them.\nLooking back on what my instincts were, K8s would be a terrible bluff because it blocks half of the hands that would have folded.\nWe are going to look at two different postflop features of GTO Wizard that may show us the blocker/unblocker value of hands. The first one is the value and trash removal scores in the \u201cSummary\u201d tab. When we bluff, we want to remove value, but not trash.\nThese are the scores for some of our bluffs:\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\nRemoval scores of BB\u2019s (river donk) bluffs\nLet\u2019s compare that to K8s, which I thought would make for a good bluff before studying this spot:\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\nIt\u2019s true that K8s removes more value, but it also removes much more trash, which we do not want because trash (better than our own trash) is all we can get to fold. So, in this hand example, our bluffs are primarily being selected based on their unblocking properties.\nGoing back to the UTG response to the lead, they raise the BB\u2019s lead 30% of the time, mostly by going all-in. The value is mostly sets and two pairs, but what about the bluffs?\nThe most common bluff is 9-x: K9s, Q9s, J9s, and 89s all turn their second pair into a bluff. The other common bluffs are the small pocket pairs (44 and 33). Finally, K5s when it is not spades bluffs.\nLet\u2019s look at the BB\u2019s response to the UTG river raise shove to see why these hands are picked to jam:\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\nBB response vs UTG\u2019s 266% pot river raise all-in\nMost of the two pairs that call feature a 9, and a set of nines is in the opponent\u2019s range, so the 9 blocks a lot of value. 89s is the master blocker in this respect, as not only does it block two pairs and sets, it also blocks the straight.\nThe BB did not bluff at the start of the river action with a K/Q/J because these cards were in the hands that UTG would\u2019ve folded, so the BB picked hands like 84s, which unblocked those folds. This is precisely why these same high cards are in the UTG bluffing range; they were never in BB\u2019s bluffing hands. So, these cards unblock BB\u2019s bluffs.\nWhat is a bad unblocker for one player is (often) a good unblocker for their opponent.\nThe other hand class that bluffs is the small pairs (44 and 33). They have the obvious blocker value of blocking the wheel straight. They also unblock the J8s\u2013J7s, T8s\u2013T7s hands that all bluffed. K5s also belongs to this category. Low pairs turned into bluffs are pretty similar. The difference is that they block another sort of value; instead of straights, they block some two pair combos that call. The similarity is that they also unblock the same bluffs as 44 and 33 do.\nAnother useful tool in GTO Wizard is the \u201cBlockers\u201d tab, which shows you whether a particular card in one player\u2019s range increases or decreases the other player\u2019s frequencies of folding/calling/raising. For example, this is the node when BB is facing an all-in. If UTG has the cards below, the feature shows the likelihood the BB will call or fold:\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\nCards sorted in UTG\u2019s range based on the increase of BB\u2019s folds\nThe 3\u2660 is the most powerful blocker, which is found sometimes in UTG\u2019s bluffing range with 33, as it simultaneously blocks straights and unblocks the hands that fold. (The only fold with a 3 in it is 73s, which is a tiny part of the opponent\u2019s range). It increases the chances of folding by 2.78%. As you can see, 6-x and 9-x also increase the folding frequency significantly, and UTG\u2019s bluff range had a lot of 9-x in it.\nSimilarly, this tab can also reveal the cards with the worst blocker value for your objective:\n Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs \n\nCards sorted in UTG\u2019s range based on the decrease of BB\u2019s folds\n2\u2660 is the worst card to bluff with, as it unblocks all the strong two pair combos that call, as well as blocking the only two pair combos that fold. Having this card in your hand increases the chances of being called by 5.93% at equilibrium.\nThroughout this article, my instinct was that K\u26608\u2660 would be a good bluff both as a lead and as a reraise. However, just like the value/trash removal feature showed me earlier, it looks like a terrible bluff. This time we can see that both those cards increase our chances of being called by a combined 0.5%.\nConclusion\nI picked preflop and river examples to cover this heuristic because, in my experience, that is when the blocker/unblocker effect is most pronounced. On the flop and turn, improvability is perhaps a more significant factor when picking bluffs.\n      * Before the flop, there is no board yet to determine which hands have improvability.\n      * On the river, there are no more cards to come, so no more ways to improve.\nWe saw that blocker/unblocker is a heuristic for picking bluffs. With two cards in your hand, it is possible to find bluffs where one of your cards blocks value and the other one unblocks folds. But this heuristic can guide us in the process of value-betting as well. A good hand to value-bet will unblock worse hands that you want to get called by while also blocking better hands that you do not want to get called by.\nThe Art of Turn-Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops\n The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops \n\nAfter calling a 3-bet as the out of position (OOP) player, you should expect to see a flop continuation bet from your in position (IP) opponent. In a 100bb CO vs BTN scenario, for example, BTN c-bets more than 80% of the time at equilibrium.\nThe 3-bettor, having taken on more risk preflop, arrives at the flop with a stronger range. On most flops, they will possess both an equity advantage and a nuts advantage, the combination of which facilitates aggressive continuation betting.\nAs the caller, you\u2019ll often end up check/folding or check/calling with the expectation that future streets will be tough to play. That\u2019s not a failure of knowledge or strategy on your part; it\u2019s merely the consequence of your bad luck for opening into a hand strong enough to 3-bet you.\nBut what happens when the IP raiser does not c-bet the flop?\n      * Is the pot now yours for the taking?\n      * Which turn cards will be better or worse for you to bet at?\n      * How much should you bet?\n      * With which hands?\nThis article will examine all that and more.\nAggregate Turn Strategy\nFor our examples, we will look at the CO vs BTN configuration, as it is the one that occurs most commonly. The general principles discussed here will apply to other configurations where the 3-bettor is in position as well, though, of course, the details will differ.\nWe can\u2019t look at CO\u2019s aggregate turn-probe strategy across all possible flops, so we\u2019ll instead look at their aggregate strategy on a variety of textures, all of which feature among BTN\u2019s most checked flops. This is less of a compromise than it may seem because there are many flops on which BTN bets all or almost all of their range. Checking really is a notable exception for them; a significant part of their strategy only on specific board textures such as the ones that follow.\n The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops \n\n The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops \n\nThe major determinant of CO\u2019s turn-probe frequency is how much equity they flop.\nHere, we see a pretty sharp divide between boards where CO frequently probes the turn and boards where they are more judicious. The major determinant of CO\u2019s turn-probe frequency is how much equity they flop: on boards where they flop half or more of the equity, they probe much more frequently than on those where they flop significantly less.\nHigher frequency turn-bets also correlate with smaller bet sizes. This makes sense: a narrower range is generally a more polar range, which benefits from larger bet sizes.\nThese different probe sizes have fundamentally different purposes (dare I say targets?). Smaller bets pressure weak hands in BTN\u2019s range, hands which could easily be drawing slim or dead, and so will struggle to continue profitably even when getting very good odds. Larger bets pressure medium hands, the sort that would happily call a smaller bet, but begin to worry about drawing dead when facing an overbet.\nOn more favorable (for IP) board textures, BTN usually c-bets their weakest hands, so a small probe from CO would not accomplish much. To the extent that they check, they are weighted toward medium hands, not weak ones.\nBTN\u2019s Flop Strategy on A\u26658\u26657\u2666\n The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops \n\nManhattan plot\n The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops \n\nAdvanced equity buckets\nThus, when BTN does not c-bet these flops, CO still mainly checks the turn, often with the intention of giving up. When CO does probe, they either have a very strong hand or represent one with a bluff. This polar strategy pressures the mostly medium hands in BTN\u2019s checking range.\nOn less favorable boards, BTN\u2019s checks come disproportionately from their weakest hands. This is partly because they have flopped more weak hands on these boards and partly because they have more incentive to protect their medium hands with a bet. Unless the turn card is one of the few that dramatically improves the weak hands in BTN\u2019s checking range, CO can probe with small bets to pressure those weak hands.\nBTN\u2019s Flop Strategy on 6\u26655\u26654\u2666\n The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops \n\n The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops \n\nTo be clear, there are still plenty of medium hands in BTN\u2019s checking range on these less favorable flops, which is why CO\u2019s equilibrium strategy still includes some polar betting. The biggest difference between BTN\u2019s strategy on better and worse flops is the prevalence of weak hands in their checking range. That, in turn, accounts for the difference in CO\u2019s use of small probe-bets.\nProbing BTN\u2019s Bad Flops\nCO\u2019s aggregate turn-probe strategy on 6\u26655\u26654\u2666 is a powerful demonstration of how starkly different the strategy is on BTN\u2019s best turn cards:\n The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops \n\nCO\u2019s aggregate turn-probe strategy on 654tt\nWhen a card from the lower half of the deck turns, CO leads most or all of their range, usually for a small size. On an 8\u2663 turn, for example, CO bets almost everything. The main exceptions are AJ and AQ, which both block and dominate BTN\u2019s folds:\n The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops \n\nManhattan plot: CO probe-bet turn strategy vs BTN on 654tt 8r\nOn low card boards, BTN\u2019s checking range is full of unpaired hands that will struggle to continue even when getting a good price.\nNotice also that CO\u2019s large bets come almost exclusively from their strongest hands (straights and sets) and weakest hands. These weakest hands tend to be unpaired hands that can make dominating hands fold while retaining a few outs when called. This includes gutshots like T9s and K9s and flush draws like Q\u2665J\u2665.\nHigh Turns\nAces and Kings are much better turns for BTN than even Queens or Jacks. On an Ace and King turn, CO rarely bets and strictly uses a larger, polarized sizing when they do bet. For example, when the A\u2663 turns, CO bets 125% pot with about 13% of their range, including sets and two pairs for value and flush and straight draws as bluffs. These bluffs still have 25\u201350% equity; CO is not fighting for the pot with their very worst hands:\n The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops \n\nManhattan plot: CO probe-bet turn strategy vs BTN on 654tt Ar\nProbing BTN\u2019s Better Flops\nWhen BTN checks a favorable flop like A\u26658\u26657\u2666, it should (usually) not be because their hand is weak. Mostly, it should be because they have something medium like KK or QQ or A3. This has a few implications for CO\u2019s probing strategy:\n      * BTN\u2019s checking range is full of bluff-catchers. With the added disadvantage of being out of position, CO can not expect to show a profit betting their worst hands on most turns. If CO were to bluff too much here, BTN could exploit them not only by bluff-catching but also by checking more traps on the flop.\n      * When CO does bet, it should be for a size that puts those modest pairs to the test.\n      * CO should probe less often on turn cards that improve the medium hands in BTN\u2019s checking range.\nThe worst turns for CO to bet are Aces, Kings, Queens, Eights, and Sevens:\n The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops \n\nCO\u2019s aggregate turn-probe strategy on A87tt\nYou might be accustomed to thinking it\u2019s good for OOP when the turn pairs the second or third card, but that\u2019s only if the preflop aggressor c-bet the flop. Because that c-betting range should be somewhat polar, cards that improve medium hands are bad for a c-bettor.\nBy that same logic, turn cards that improve medium hands are good for the preflop aggressor if they did not c-bet the flop. Their range is thick with hands like Q9, K8, and KK, which like seeing a board pair or a Broadway card roll off.\nFlush and straight draws, on the other hand, are appealing c-betting candidates. That means BTN is less likely to have them after checking, so flushing and straightening turns are better cards for CO to probe. Very low cards also do not interact with BTN\u2019s checking range, and so are good cards for CO to probe as well.\nCO\u2019s probe strategy on A\u26658\u26657\u2666 3\u2666 looks much like their probe strategy for playing an Ace turn on a flop that\u2019s less favorable to BTN. That is, CO bets big and polar, drawing their bluffs not from air but from draws. This particular board offers both heart and diamond draws, so the lowest-equity bluffs are poor straight draws like 6\u26605\u2660, not complete air:\n The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops \n\nManhattan plot: CO probe-bet turn strategy vs BTN on A\u26658\u26657\u2666 3\u2666\nIf the 3 on the turn is a third \u2665, CO\u2019s betting pattern looks quite similar, but the size of their bet shifts downward, preferring 75% pot to overbets. In fact, they use this smaller sizing on all heart turns:\n The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops \n\nManhattan plot: CO probe-bet turn strategy vs BTN on A\u26658\u26657\u2666 3\u2665\nDespite the incentive to bet flush draws on the flop, BTN does retain some in their checking range. Some of their medium hands also pick up flush draws, making them more comfortable calls even against overbets. However, the pairs that did not turn flush draws will have tough decisions even against the 75% pot bet, given how easily they could be drawing dead.\nCO\u2019s betting pattern is similar on a worse turn like the Q\u2666, but with less betting overall:\n The Art of Turn Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops \n\nManhattan plot: CO probe-bet turn strategy vs BTN on A\u26658\u26657\u2666 Q\u2666\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that CO mixes 125% and 175% pot on the 3\u2666 turn but uses 125% exclusively on the Q\u2666. They simply don\u2019t want to put as much money into the pot when the turn card is so likely to help their already somewhat strong opponent.\nConclusion\nThe 3-bettor will have a stronger preflop range than the caller. That translates into an equity advantage on most flops, which, combined with a positional advantage, discourages their opponent from contesting the pot with weak hands. Even when the 3-bettor checks the flop, it will often be correct for you to check and give up on the turn if you\u2019ve got nothing going on.\nJust how much you need to have going on depends on the board texture\u2026\nKeep an eye out for favorable turn cards that could provide turn-probing opportunities, while selecting for the discussed hand categories/types.\nThe Many Faces of Balance in Poker\n The Many Faces of Balance in Poker \n\nWhen you think of balance in poker, what comes to mind?\nMost likely, you were introduced to the concept by the relationship between bluffing and bluff-catching. If your betting range is imbalanced\u2014if you bluff too much or not enough, relative to the number of value hands you could have in a given spot\u2014then your opponent can exploit you by bluff-catching more or less. Conversely, if they bluff-catch too much or not enough, you can exploit them by bluffing less or more.\n The Many Faces of Balance in Poker \n\nThis is a great introductory example of how balance functions because it is simple, clean, and straightforwardly calculated (on the river, anyway). It\u2019s easy to see the relationship between your strategy and your opponent\u2019s, and how an imbalance on one side of the scale incentivizes the other player to be imbalanced as well in order to exploit the deviation.\nThis is just one simple example of balance, however. Many other such relationships exist, operating behind the scenes. And, as they all play a part in shaping the equilibrium strategies returned by solvers, they can also be used to explain why the outputs look the way they do, with so many different hands mixing at specific frequencies.\nMost of them, however, are not as easily calculated as bluffing and bluff-catching frequencies, so the goal of this article is not to solve them precisely (you wouldn\u2019t be able to do so during in-game situations anyway) but simply to understand the relationships so that you can think more deeply about vulnerabilities in your strategies and those of your opponents.\nEarly Streets\nBefore the river, most hands can not be neatly classified as \u201cbluff\u201d or \u201cvalue.\u201d Colloquially, we may categorize a hand as a bluff, but for a deeper understanding of its true nature, it\u2019s important to recognize the following fact:\nA hand\u2019s ability to still win the pot if called, whether by improving or bluffing again, is an important difference from river bluffs.\nThe general relationship between bluffing and bluff-catching still exists on earlier streets, but the ratios do not usually work out so cleanly because hands are not as clearly defined. There is also a new balance to consider when betting or facing a bet:\n The Many Faces of Balance in Poker \n\nBecause hands can change value, there is some incentive for a player facing a bet to raise with bluff-catchers rather than calling, as they would on the river.\nThe reward of raising bluff-catchers is that it enables them to deny equity or get additional value from draws and perhaps even to push the opponent off a better hand that was itself betting for thin value and protection.\nThe risk of raising bluff-catchers is that it could mean putting in money when way behind against the top of the bettor\u2019s range and missing profitable bluff-catches against the bottom on future streets.\nGTO betting ranges usually consist of:\n      * A more polar component of hands, which do not mind getting raised (strong hands are happy to continue, very weak hands lose little beyond the initial bet when they fold), and\n      * A more linear component of hands, which benefit from folds, do not mind getting called but hate getting raised.\nThese linear hands include both semi-bluffs and thin value-bets from non-nut hands, many of which will not be strong enough to bet again on future streets but can benefit from denying equity while still having a reasonable chance of winning when called.\nAn overly polar betting range offers the opponent little incentive to raise. An overly linear betting range offers little incentive to call.\nThe balance between the polar and linear components corresponds with the balance between the opponent\u2019s calling and raising frequencies.\nBoard Coverage\n\u201cBoard coverage\u201d is a nebulous concept that, although related to balance, is harder to quantify. Essentially, the way to achieve board coverage and the motivation behind it comes down to the following:\nIn any non-folding range (betting, checking, calling, raising), players are incentivized to include a variety of hand types so that they will not be overly predictable on future streets.\nFor example, if there are two hearts on the board (\u2665\u2665X), it will generally be correct to have flush draws in both your betting and checking ranges so that your opponent cannot confidently value-bet non-flush hands on the next street that brings a third \u2665 no matter what your action is on the current street.\nIt will also generally be correct to have other weak hands besides flush draws in both ranges, so that you have something to bluff with when the flush comes in. I first learned this concept from Alex Sutherland, who has an excellent demonstration on his now-defunct GTO Range Builder blog.\n The Many Faces of Balance in Poker \n\nThe amount of money your opponent will put into the pot on future branches of the game tree determines your incentive to arrive at those branches with certain hands. This is related to the concept of \u201cimplied odds\u201d\u2014the incentive to call with a drawing hand despite not getting the right immediate odds because of additional bets you could win if the draw comes in\u2014though it is more complex than that. Taking weak hands to future streets can be correct not only because they may over-realize equity by value-betting when they improve but also because they may over-realize equity by bluffing when they don\u2019t improve.\nThis can only be taken so far, however. Not even solvers can profitably design strategies that will be perfectly balanced on all possible runouts! Typically, they invest in balance for big classes of hands like flush and straight draws but do not find it worth the cost to invest in otherwise worthless hands just to balance around edge cases such as the one or two cards that complete both draws. In those rare cases, they simply accept that they are imbalanced and make the best of it.\nActing First on the River\nThe above concept applies not only on early streets but also when you are acting first on the river (or really, any time you are not closing the action). It is about future decision points, not necessarily future streets. But on the river, it is most often a consideration for the player acting first.\n The Many Faces of Balance in Poker \n\nBecause the out of position (OOP) player\u2019s checks do not close the action, they have some incentive to check their strongest hands, to induce bets (such as bluffs and value-bets from worse) and then get in a raise. They also have some incentive to bet their strongest hands, to induce bluff- and value-raises from worse (in addition to getting calls from worse hands that would have checked).\nThe same can be said for the in position (IP) player, if they are using multiple sizes. They have some obvious incentive to bet big (often all-in) with their nut hands, but they also have incentive to bet smaller as a trap, hoping to induce raises from hands that would not have called a shove.\nMuch as on earlier streets, the ratio of traps to thin value is what determines the opponent\u2019s incentive to raise as a bluff or for value with their own non-nut hands.\n      * Traps are hands that want to get raised.\n      * Thin value are hands that are ahead when called but lose EV when raised (because they will sometimes lose to bluffs when they fold and lose to strong hands when they call).\nFacing a Raise Before the Flop\nAll the above considerations apply to preflop play as well, which is, of course, an early street. In fact, the difficulty of classifying hands as \u201cbluff\u201d or \u201cvalue\u201d is especially salient before the flop, where it\u2019s tough for any hand to have more than 70% or less than 30% equity. The extra wrinkle before the flop is that, unless the action folds to the SB, you are potentially playing a multiway pot, and the whole idea of equilibrium gets tricky in multiway pots.\n Principles of GTO \n\nSuppose HJ opens, and you 3-bet from the CO. You\u2019ve got a well-constructed range balanced around the concepts we\u2019ve discussed above with a linear component incentivizing HJ to 4-bet and a polar component incentivizing HJ to call and a smattering of suited connectors so you\u2019ve got something to bluff with on Broadway boards and something to stack off with on medium, connected boards. Then along comes the BTN and kicks over your precisely balanced scale with a cold 4-bet.\nYour 3-bet range is still mostly balanced against the original raiser, determined mostly by how often they will call and 4-bet and how they will play after the flop, because they are by far the player most likely to contest the pot with you. But you are also constrained by the other players holding cards, which is why CO VPIPs more hands into an LJ open than HJ does and BTN VPIPs more still. They\u2019re all facing the same original raise, but with more players remaining to act behind them, the earlier position players need stronger hands to contest the pot.\nResponse to LJ Raise, 100bb Cash\n The Many Faces of Balance in Poker \n\nWhat\u2019s all this got to do with balance and exploitability?\nSuppose you\u2019re in the CO facing a raise, and you know the BTN is an extremely tight and passive player who will fold far more hands than a solver would and rarely raise. Or, if you\u2019re playing live poker, maybe you look left and see them preparing to fold their cards. In either case, you basically have the BTN and can play a strategy that involves a lot more calling than you would typically do in this spot (which is still not terribly much, to be clear!).\nConversely, if the BTN is overactive, you should be a bit tighter in the CO and favor a raise-or-fold strategy.\nPlaying Kingmaker\nIn heads-up pots, mixed strategies are all about balance.\nWhen a solver mixes a certain hand between, say, bets and checks, that\u2019s because there\u2019s incentive to have that hand in both ranges.\nIf you show up with any type of hand too often in one range, your opponent could exploit you in some way.\nThis is not necessarily the case in a multiway pot, however. Notice how, in BTN\u2019s response to a LJ raise, virtually every VPIPing hand mixes call and raise:\n The Many Faces of Balance in Poker \n\nBTN response vs LJ min-raise: EV display (NL500, 100bb)\nYou could fiddle around with these mixes of calls vs raises\u2014doing a lot more calling or a lot more raising\u2014and it would not affect your EV or exploitability nearly as much as it would in a heads-up pot. What you\u2019re essentially doing by turning these dials is determining how the remaining EV is split between the players left to act (e.g., LJ and BB, and, to a lesser extent, SB).\n The Many Faces of Balance in Poker \n\nIt\u2019s generally better for LJ when you raise, as this makes it much less likely the blinds will contest the pot and so more likely LJ will win it if you do not. Raising does not so much accrue EV for yourself as it does redistribute EV from BB \u2192 LJ.\nConversely, calling makes it more likely the blinds will enter the pot, allowing them to realize their equity at LJ\u2019s expense. Sure, sometimes the blinds win a pot you would have won had you 3-bet, but calling has the advantage of risking less than raising would.\nSo for you, it often ends up being an even tradeoff, with most hands showing no clear preference for calling or raising. LJ loves it when you 3-bet because they benefit from the fold equity you are paying for, whereas BB loves it when you call because they get cheap overcalling opportunities you allowed for.\nThat\u2019s what the equilibria look like, anyway. In a real-game situation, LJ might be a tough opponent and BB a soft one. In that case, you have a lot of incentive to call, as you don\u2019t want to do your tough opponent any favors and you\u2019d welcome weakness in the pot. Whereas if LJ is the soft player, you\u2019d like to isolate weakness by 3-betting more aggressively to shut out tough opponents in the blinds.\nConclusion\nSolver strategies are a product of a series of precisely balanced compromises between competing incentives. Every little detail matters, even if it is not obvious how. There is some reason why the solver calls K6s but not K7s. And there is some reason why it does so 20% of the time rather than 18%.\nSome of these reasons are based on the opponent\u2019s incentives on the current street, while others will pay off on specific runouts on future streets. Often, it\u2019s both. Solvers are extremely efficient in this way.\nHowever, you will never get all these balances exactly right in a real-game situation, and neither will your opponents. But by understanding all the tradeoffs, you can make better decisions about how to remain roughly balanced yourself. Plus, you will also be better equipped to predict imbalances in your opponents\u2019 play and introduce intentional imbalances in your own game to exploit theirs.\nDominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP\n Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP \n\nPlaying the river may seem scary. Pots, on average, have been swelling up big time at this point, and even small mistakes can mean a substantial loss of big blinds. But do not panic because after digesting this article, you will be ready to outplay your opponents and maneuver as the preflop aggressor (PFA) from out of position (OOP) through all kinds of challenging river spots in 3-bet pots. Let\u2019s get our feet (and hands) wet by immersing ourselves in the world of rivers!\nImpact of Earlier Streets\nAs discussed in the previous article \u201cMastering Turn Play in 3-Bet Pots OOP,\u201d earlier streets have significant consequences for our game on later streets. How we construct our turn range will always affect how we play the river.\nLet\u2019s examine the following scenario more closely to understand how turn play impacts our river game plan.\n Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP \n\nThe SB 3-bettor\u2019s turn barrel strategy vs BTN on K93tt 2r (after flop went B20-C)\nAfter frequently betting for a small sizing on the flop, the SB arrives with an extensive range on the turn, and so does the BTN. Due to the excellent pot odds, IP has to defend very wide versus a 20% flop c-bet.\nHands like second pair (9-x) and underpairs (TT\u2013QQ) are, therefore, still strong enough to bet again for a small sizing. They get called by worse pairs and benefit from protection by denying a decent amount of EQ. On the other hand, the SB still has a notable number of hands that want to build even larger pots, such as strong King-x, two pairs, and sets. These hand classes would prefer a bigger turn sizing.\nWe can now use different turn strategies. Let us determine how splitting the betting between a small (20% pot) and big (75% pot) turn sizing will impact how we play the river on a board-pairing nine.\n Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP \n\nThe SB 3-bettor\u2019s triple barrel river strategy vs BTN on K93tt 2r 9r (after flop B20-C, turn B20-C)\nRiver After Small Turn Barrel\nFirst, let us explore the river after betting small on the turn. When we take a look at the \u201cRanges\u201d tab and the \u201cEquity chart,\u201d a couple of things stand out immediately:\n      * The SB shows up with a considerable advantage on the river! Betting 20% on the turn allows OOP to include a good chunk of 9-x, which means OOP rivers some amount of trips, even relatively close to the amount of the IP player.\n      * OOP arrives with more full houses on the river. IP raises their sets and K9 very aggressively on earlier streets versus the small sizes, while we put hands like KK into our small-betting range since they block much of the hands that call bigger bets.\n      * OOP has a significant advantage in TT\u2013QQ (underpairs), while IP has way more third pairs. The SB is small-betting the turn a lot with those TT\u2013QQ, while the BTN is forced to continue with a notable amount (over 80% of the time) of third pairs versus a 20% bet. This means those underpairs are still worth a small bet on the river in SB\u2019s shoes because IP has so many weaker pairs.\n      * TLDR: The SB\u2019s range, in general, dominates IP\u2019s range. Due to the nature of both ranges\u2014with the BTN being forced to continue with an extensive range on the turn (almost 85% of the time) and the SB already having an advantage on flop and turn\u2014the SB gets to bet river very frequently with a merged range for various sizes.\nRiver After Large Turn Barrel\nTo further drive home the point of the impact of turn play, let us now take a glance at our river strategy after using a bigger (75% pot) turn bet:\n Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP \n\nThe SB 3-bettor\u2019s triple barrel river strategy vs BTN on K93tt 2r 9r (after flop B20-C, turn B75-C)\nWe will, once again, consult the same tools\u2014the \u201dRanges\u201d tab and \u201cEquity chart\u201d\u2014 to understand what\u2019s happening. What differences do we notice?\n      * What stands out the most is that the SB now finds themselves at a disadvantage in most of the different range parts. OOP doesn\u2019t double barrel any 9-x for a large sizing, while IP still defends all 9-x. The BTN also gets to continue significantly less versus the 75% pot bet sizing, which heavily filters IP\u2019s range and makes it much tighter. IP arrives on the river with almost 3 times fewer underpairs, way fewer bricked draws, and practically no single Ace-high. IP\u2019s range is much stronger and more concentrated around top pairs and trips.\n      * OOP, conversely, arrives with much more air and even significantly fewer nutted hands on the river. The result is that the SB now has to check a lot and can not use large sizes due to the nut disadvantage that they find themselves in.\nThe drastic differences in OOP\u2019s river strategy showcased how important it is to understand how our ranges look on previous streets.\nBuilding an unbreakable river strategy to bridge across requires understanding the foundations laid in the earlier streets because you will be building on top of them.\nIf this clicks with you and you want to learn more about how to master flop and turn in 3-bet pots OOP, these previous articles provide a good pathway into just that:\nFlop \u2013 Crush 3-Bet Pots OOP in Cash Games\n Crush 3-Bet Pots OOP in Cash Games \n\nTurn \u2013 Mastering Turn Play in 3-Bet Pots OOP\n Mastering Turn Play in 3-Bet Pots OOP \n\nWhy Using Multiple Sizes on the River Is Essential\nWe generally split our range into multiple sizes because there are various hand classes that explicitly want to bet different amounts to achieve different things. As we examined in the previous articles about playing 3-bet pots OOP, using multiple sizes on earlier streets is not mandatory.\nThe EV difference between having a more complex strategy with multiple sizes and a simple one with just one size is often very close. The issue is that the difficulty of executing a multi-size strategy will increase drastically compared to the simplified single-size strategy. Splitting our range as early as the flop and/or turn implies a larger game tree with many more nodes and branches that have to be considered and studied. In theory, all these different lines have to be balanced with the right amount of strong hands and bluffs. The following graphic displays the exponential nature of game complexity when using various flop and turn sizes:\n      * On the left, a simpler game tree with one bet size on flop and turn, to only split on the river into two bet sizes.\n      * On the right, a more complex game tree that already splits from the flop onward into two bet sizes.\n(Keep in mind that there\u2019s always the check option as well.)\n Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP \n\nThe complexity of game trees: simpler (12 river nodes) vs more complex (27 river nodes)\nWe are not robots. Going with a relatively simple strategy that you\u2019re able to play on a high level will consistently outperform a more complex one where we make way more mistakes and theoretically only gain a minimal amount of EV.\nHowever, there are situations where we certainly want to mix multiple sizes on earlier streets for exploitative reasons, such as spots where our opponents are too passive and do not raise enough versus the small sizing. All our nutted hands would now heavily miss out on value when not enough money goes into the pot. This means we need to take matters into our own hands and use a big sizing for our strongest hands and a smaller one for our marginal hand classes. We don\u2019t need to concern ourselves with balancing both of our lines as we are purely focusing on what each hand in our range wants. This will always be our highest EV choice versus weak opponents who are unable to counter effectively.\nWe aren\u2019t there yet, though; there is one last street to traverse. Once we\u2019re on the river, splitting our range into multiple sizings becomes indispensable; if you bet small on the flop with a hand that wants to build a large pot, you can still use huge sizes on the river to put in as much money as you wish. After the river, though, the hand ends. We need to find a size now that fits our hand\u2019s value. When we arrive on the river with distinct hand classes who explicitly want to put in different amounts of money, we must build our strategy around two sizings. Since the hand ends on the river, there is also no future street complexity to worry about.\nIf you feel like digging deeper into the topic of whether multiple sizes actually matter, jump in here \ud83d\udd73\ufe0f\ud83d\udc07\nNow we have learned why splitting the river is mandatory, we are mentally prepared to dive into that strategic complexity. 3, 2, 1, \u2026\nDiving Into the River\nAlthough it might sound counterintuitive, the river is the easiest street to play on. There are no future streets to worry about, and ranges are often more defined and filtered.\nHowever, playing the river is still no child\u2019s play. Due to all the different rivers, finding a way to get a grip on a strong river strategy can feel elusive. We need to simplify our approach to rivers so we can smoothly navigate through all of them.\nGrouping rivers will help us to find patterns and design heuristics effectively.\nTo get a better understanding of river play, we are going to explore two different groups:\n      * Brick river\n      * Nut-changing river\nDry, Brick Rivers\nTo portray how to play on cards that don\u2019t shuffle up the equity distribution of the ranges after the turn action has concluded, we will examine A\u26609\u26632\u2665 7\u2660 4\u2666.\n Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP \n\nThe SB 3-bettor\u2019s triple barrel river strategy vs BTN on A92tt 7r 4r (after flop B20-C, turn B75-C): 100bb starting\nWhen reviewing the river strategy, one thing should immediately catch your eye!\n      * The SB mainly has one large (all-in) sizing. The only hand that wants to use a smaller sizing is AJ. AJ only makes up roughly 3.6% of our entire range. When certain hands wanting to use a specific size are very scarce, we don\u2019t need to bother building a strategy around that.\nThe question is, why do we just use one large sizing here?\nLet us find out together with the help of the EQ buckets and chart!\n Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP \n\nThe EQ buckets and chart on A92tt 7r 4r (left = SB, right = BTN)\nWhat do you notice here? There are two interesting things to find that explain why the SB only wants to go all-in (87% pot):\n      * The EQ buckets and chart from the SB clearly indicate a highly polarized range. The SB has considerably more nutted and strong hands with 80\u2013100% EQ but also way more very low equity hands (air) below 25% EQ.\n      * The BTN\u2019s range, however, is dense in bluff-catchers with between 25\u201370% EQ. All hands with more than 80% EQ (i.e., AQ and better) are strong enough to go all-in, given that the SPR < 1.\nThis undoubtedly shows us that due to SB\u2019s polar nature and the relatively low SPR, they have little\u2014remember AJ\u2014to no interest in using a smaller size. This is usually the case on brick river runouts after having polarized previous streets being 100bb deep. We can often simplify to checking or going all-in.\nIt is important to note that SPR plays an important role here, though!\nDeeper Rivers\n Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP \n\nThe SB 3-bettor\u2019s river strategy vs BTN on on A92tt 7r 4r (after flop B20-C, turn B125-C): 200bb starting\nWhen we explore the same spot, but being 200bb deep, we can see that the SB now clearly wants to use non-all-in sizes too. Hands like AK/AQ that were previously strong enough to go all-in, don\u2019t get called enough by worse when they jam with an SPR of ~1.28 (instead of ~0.86). In this case, it\u2019s worth building a smaller size around a hand like AK since this hand alone makes up almost 20% of OOP\u2019s river range in this spot!\nWet, Nut-Changing Rivers\nTo contrast, we can compare the same spot up to the point where the river card now changes the nuts: a flush-completing 4\u2665.\n Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP \n\nThe SB 3-bettor\u2019s river strategy vs BTN on A92tt 7r 4t flush-completer (after flop B20-C, turn B75-C): 100bb starting\nComparing the river strategy on the flush-completing 4 demonstrates one thing:\n      * OOP now clearly wants to use one small and one large size. All of SB\u2019s strong turn hands, such as two pairs or the best top pairs, got devalued on this nut-changing river. They are now only strong enough to bet for a small size. Blocking the river often outperforms checking in nut-changing spots, because we prevent the opponent from checking back all worse hands or re-opening the action for a larger size.\nLet\u2019s switch tabs\u2014from \u201cStrategy\u201d to \u201cRanges\u201d\u2014to examine the reasons for this strategic shift a bit more closely.\n Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP \n\nThe EQ buckets and chart on A92tt 7r 4t flush-completer (left = SB, right = BTN)\nThe EQ buckets and chart are now slightly different. The BTN gains a significant amount of nutted hands, which severely reduces the SB\u2019s nut advantage. Due to the nut change, all of SB\u2019s turn nuts, and very strong hands such as AK or two pairs are now downgraded in the hierarchy of EQ buckets. For that reason, OOP now dominates the buckets between 25 and 80%; it also perfectly illustrates why OOP wants to have a small-betting range: OOP has a lot of medium-strength hands now that still can go for thin value but are too weak to jam.\nThe slightly more tricky part is now to figure out which size each hand prefers.\n      * Value \u2013 We need to define a value threshold to determine which hand classes go for what size. Looking at the river strategy, we want to jam with all our sets and better. Our two pairs, AK and AQ, go into our small sizing. A cool heuristic here is that the weakest hand that could have gone all-in on a brick river also fits the threshold for blocking on a nut-changing river. We put some of our flushes into our small size to prevent our small-betting range from becoming too weak. Usually, flushes that heavily block the calling range, like K\u2665Q\u2665.\n      * Bluffs \u2013 Finding the right bluffs for each sizing can be more challenging. But don\u2019t worry, we got you! Generally, on the river, it comes down to blocking effects:\n\u2022  Using bluffs with good blocking effects for our big sizes.\n\u2022  And bluffs with poor blocking qualities use the small sizes or just give up.\nThis begs the question: \u201cWhat are good and bad blocking effects?\u201d\nThe answer is: \u201cIt depends\u2026 on what your hand wants to accomplish.\u201d\nWhen it comes to bluffing hands, look for these effects:\nBlock calls\nBlock folds\n Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP \n\nUnblock folds\n Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP \n\nUnblock calls\nIs your bluff buff?\nLet\u2019s apply this to our river spot:\n      * Good bluffs are hands like KQo with one \u2665; these are fantastic combos for the big size, blocking strong flushes and calls like AK/AQ one \u2665.\n      * Poor bluffs are hands like 65 that don\u2019t block the folding range, which is decent, but don\u2019t block any strong hands. They can go into our small-betting range. They also benefit more from folding out better air, such as T8. So we don\u2019t need to get many folds to be profitable. Pretty bad bluffs would be hands like JTs, not really blocking calls and mainly blocking villain\u2019s folds such as AT/AJ.\nNote that it isn\u2019t always possible to be so picky. Sometimes, it\u2019s also a question of whether you run out of (pretty) bluffs. The fewer bluffs you have to choose from, the less picky you can be.\nCurious for more info on this topic, chase the rabbit here \ud83d\udd73\ufe0f\ud83d\udc07\nWhen Being Allowed to Over-Fold the River\nYou might have heard about MDF (Minimum Defense Frequency). It describes the minimum amount of hands within your range that you need to defend to remain unexploitable. While this often applies, there are spots where we are allowed to over-fold relative to MDF.\nLet\u2019s look at a practical hand example to see this concept in action. We can use the same spot as before, which has the additional benefit of keeping us in familiar waters.\n Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP \n\nThe SB 3-bettor\u2019s river strategy vs BTN\u2019s all-in (87% pot) on A92tt 7r 4r (after river X)\nAfter facing a BTN all-in for 87% pot, MDF suggests that OOP must roughly defend 53.5% of their range. As we can see, though, the SB massively over-folds here by only defending 10.8% of range.\n      * As we already determined, OOP\u2019s range is highly polarized, and IP\u2019s range mainly consists of bluff-catchers. OOP doesn\u2019t gain anything from checking strong hands on the river because IP has no incentive to re-open marginal hands into a polarized range built around nuts or air.\n Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP \n\nThe SB-3-bettor\u2019s first-in river strategy filtered for 80%+ equity\nBy examining OOP\u2019s best hands with more than 80% EQ, we can confirm that the SB basically never checks their strongest hands.\nThe BTN is now able to bluff all their air without getting punished. To be clear, the SB is not getting exploited here. They already gained their EV by polarizing on earlier streets and having no incentive to check the river with strong hands due to the polar vs condensed range dynamics. The BTN doesn\u2019t get to float all their air on the turn, and then on the river, they just get to hammer into OOP once they check. The SB will often just bet themselves, so IP doesn\u2019t get much opportunity to bluff. These spots where OOP over-folds the river usually occur when OOP has bet flop and turn with a highly polarized range.\nFascinating to explore because we get to see counterintuitive concepts manifest due to the nature of both ranges.\nOne Important River Exploit\nExploring theoretical concepts can be very helpful in grasping the complexity of particular spots. It even becomes mandatory to study theory to understand what mistakes our opponents are making and how we can capitalize on them. In practice, we always want to deviate as much as possible to capture the highest EV.\nThere is one spot in particular where many players leave a lot of money on the table. Instead of simply explaining the exploit, let\u2019s do a little experiment with our nodelocking tool using custom solutions. Let\u2019s get in the lab!\n Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP \n\nThe SB 3-bettor\u2019s triple barrel river strategy on K92tt 5r 8t flush-completer (after flop B33-C, turn B67-C): 200bb starting\nOOP\u2019s strategy on the nut-changing 8\u2666 dictates a lot of blocking. IP arrives with slightly more flushes and sets on the river. Overall, it\u2019s a pretty decent card for the BTN.\nLet\u2019s assume we face an overly passive player who is not raising enough versus the block-bet. IP has to raise over 20% facing the small size!\nNow, when we nodelock villain to raise only half of the time, by taking out especially the thin value-raises such as specific two pairs or sets. The result is an eye-opener:\n Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP \n\nThe SB 3-bettor\u2019s triple river strategy on K92tt 5r 8t flush-completer after nodelocking IP\u2019s strategy:\nRaise frequency vs block = ~10% instead of ~20%\nWe are now checking approximately 25% less and using the 2x pot all-in size 4 times as often. Pretty cool, right?\n      * We check significantly less because IP is not raising enough. This means our block sizing realizes more EQ, and we are pushed less often off our hand.\n      * We also use the all-in sizing considerably more because villain is not raising thin enough. Our nutted hands severely bleed EV when they are not getting raised enough. A decent heuristic is that in spots where we know villain is not raising enough, especially with thin value, we don\u2019t want to put our strong hands into the small size.\nRemember that most players in lower- and even mid-stakes games are often too passive, so this exploit will help you outplay many opponents!\nConclusion\nPlaying the river in 3-bet pots OOP can be tricky. This should not discourage us from seeking new knowledge to fortify our game or pursuing new abilities. The following concepts will help you in your journey to 3-bet pot river excellence as the OOP player!\n      * How we constructed our ranges and influenced our opponent\u2019s on previous streets is the foundation that a sound river approach is built upon. To avoid slipping up on how to play the river, recall the previous streets\u2019 actions and how that shaped the ranges.\n      * Using multiple sizes on earlier streets is not mandatory. The EV difference is often minimal and doesn\u2019t make up for the increase in complexity of the game tree, which can cause EV loss itself. River splitting becomes essential in spots with different hand classes to bet. The fact that the hand ends on the river means this is our last opportunity to build a pot of a certain size, and at the same time, we do not need to worry about future complexity.\n      * When we polarized on previous streets, and the river card doesn\u2019t change the equity distributions, we can often simplify to jamming and checking at 100bb deep. The deeper we are, the more we establish multiple sizings, even on bricks.\n      * We must implement one small sizing for our medium-strength hands on nut-changing runouts.\n      * OOP is often allowed to over-fold in highly polarized river spots after betting flop and turn to then check the river due to the nature of both ranges.\n      * In spots where we know villain is not raising enough versus our small river size, we need to take matters into our own hands. This means putting our strongest hands into our big-betting range to avoid leaving a lot of value on the table.\nPicking the Right Semi-Bluffs\n Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs \n\nAs I often like to remind readers, I am not a professional poker player; I am just a writer who is well-versed in solvers. My writing at GTO Wizard is very much colored by the perspective of a student trying to plug leaks in his own game.\nWith that in mind, today I am writing about a big leak I fixed in 2024. My coach, Dara O\u2019Kearney, got me on the right track initially by explaining the error of my way, and since then, I have used GTO Wizard to really hammer the lesson home.\nThe leak was related to semi-bluffing.\nMost bluffs should be \u2018natural,\u2019 as in they have some property that increases their chances of winning, even if it is not a \u2018made\u2019 hand.\n      * Having a blocker, especially on the river, is a natural bluff as it reduces the number of combinations that can call.\n      * A semi-bluff is the other type of natural bluff. This is when you bluff with a draw and if you get called, you have a good chance of improving to a very strong hand.\n The Three Laws of Indifference \n\nThe leak I had belongs to the second category. My natural instinct was to make my biggest bluffs with my biggest draws. For example, I would only overbet-bluff or check/raise-bluff with hands such as the nut flush draw. I would rarely get too out of line with more speculative draws like gutshots or backdoor draws.\nMy logic was that if I were going to take on the risk of making a big bluff, I would want to have the best chance of getting there if I got action.\nThis, it turns out, is often backward logic. It\u2019s probably best to jump into a hand to explain why.\nPicking Semi-Bluffs on the Flop\nThis is an NL500 cash game example where UTG has opened, and the BTN has cold-called. The flop is J\u2665T\u26652\u2663.\nThis is UTG\u2019s first-in flop action:\n Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs \n\n Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs \n\nUTG c-bet flop strategy on JT2tt vs BTN: 100bb starting, NL500\nWe see mostly checks from UTG, who is out of position on a board where the BTN is not a huge underdog. UTG has 54% equity overall, but the BTN has plenty of strong hands themselves, including top set.\nA year ago, my instinct would be to make my bluffs the very strong draws, which on this board would be hands like A\u2665K\u2665 and A\u2665Q\u2665 for a combo draw+overcards. It would also be hands like K\u2665Q\u2665, Q\u26659\u2665 and 9\u26658\u2665 for the mega draw that is the open-ended straight flush draw, sometimes with strong pair outs on top.\nHowever, looking at these hands on the grid, they are all bet less than half the time, and when we drill down further, the flush draw (i.e., heart) variant is bet the least. These are the checking frequencies of our mega draws, the hands that can turn a straight, as well as a flush if they have hearts. (I\u2019m using the checking frequency rather than betting frequency just because there will be a mix of bet sizes, and this is an easier way to highlight overall aggression):\n Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs \n\nThere are some outliers, K\u2665Q\u2665 for example, which is bet more than any other KQs, but the trend is quite clear.\n      * If you have a flush draw (i.e., hearts) to go with your straight draw, you are betting much less often than if you just had a straight draw.\n      * The other interesting thing to note is that when you have a straight draw with a backdoor flush draw (i.e., clubs), you bet the most often.\nWhy is this?\nThere are a number of reasons. Let\u2019s first look at the equities of all the hands above:\n Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs \n\nIn some instances, the heart combos have almost twice as much equity as their non-flush draw counterpart. In every instance, the heart combo draw has more than 50% equity, and in the case of A\u2665K\u2665 has 67.4% equity.\nCan we actually call them bluffs at this point? One of the reasons these hands don\u2019t get bet as often as the other draws is because they are too strong. We\u2019d actually hate to bet A\u2665K\u2665 and get a fold in this spot.\nTo highlight this further, the most frequently bluffed hand is 97s, which is bluffed 69.5% of the time overall. It bluffs 96.2% of the time when clubs, but only 10.8% of the time when hearts. So, our most frequently bluffed hand is just a gutshot most of the time.\nThis all boils down to a fundamental aspect of bluffing, which is:\n Responding to BB Squeezes \n\nFor a hand to be considered a bluff, it needs to be weak enough so that taking down the pot uncontested is one of the best possible outcomes.\nThese combo draws have too much equity, and we want to make sure we realize more of it, so we check to induce bets and/or see the next street.\nAn interesting note about why the (club) backdoor draws bluff the most. This is because they have a prospect of profitably firing second barrels on many turn cards. If they don\u2019t turn their straight when called, they might turn a club, which means they can bluff the turn with a straight and flush draw. And in case they get reraised on the flop, it\u2019s easy to let go of it. Practically speaking, the times they do make the club flush by the river, they have a very well-disguised hand that most real-life opponents would discount entirely.\nAnother way to determine why these hands rarely bluff is to look at what folds. This is the response to the 33% pot bet:\n Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs \n\n Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs \n\nBTN response vs UTG\u2019s 33% pot c-bet\nSome small pocket pairs fold, and some Ace-x hands fold, and the rest is trash essentially. In equity terms, our combo draw range was massively ahead of all of these hands. Especially A\u2665K\u2665 and A\u2665Q\u2665, which were dominating the Ace-x and would have been very happy to turn top pair against them. The hands that fold are all hands we would have preferred to keep in the pot with our mega draw.\nThis was the first-in flop betting range for UTG as the OOP player. It\u2019s a common strategy to check/raise big draws, so let\u2019s quickly rule that out. If UTG checks, this is the BTN\u2019s betting range:\n Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs \n\n Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs \n\nBTN flop betting strategy vs UTG check\nWe won\u2019t explore it in detail because it\u2019s very repetitive, but the BTN has a lot of the same combo draws as UTG, and they keep to the same strategy of betting least often with straight+flush draws, and betting most with straight+backdoor flush draws.\nWhen the BTN does bet, it is mostly an overbet, and this is the UTG response:\n Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs \n\n Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs \n\nUTG response vs BTN\u2019s 125% pot overbet\nIt\u2019s a very narrow check/raise range. All our combo draw hands mostly call (and are calling a larger bet than we would have made if we were first to bet it).\nHowever, the few times we do check/raise bluff with a draw, we do so at a higher frequency with the combo draw that has hearts. It\u2019s such a small part of the range that it is almost insignificant, but as the BTN has strengthened their range by raising, we need a much stronger bluffing candidate when we reraise with a draw.\nPicking Semi-Bluffs on the Turn\nLet\u2019s rewind and go back to the original strategy where UTG checks and it gets checked back to them. This is UTG\u2019s first-in turn action:\n Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs \n\n Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs \n\nUTG delayed c-bet turn strategy on JT2tt 3r vs BTN\nThe overall betting frequency has increased as the BTN has weakened their range by not betting. Let\u2019s see what happens now with our combo draw hands:\n gto wizard picking the right semi bluffs extra final 3 \n\nOn the flop, all these hands were mostly checking, but now on the turn, they are all mostly betting, including our heart combo draws, which bet more than 70% of the time. However, the heart combos still bet less often than the ones without a flush draw.\nTo see why, let\u2019s once again look at the equities:\n Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs \n\nMost of our combo draws are now under 50% equity, averaging 43.01%. This means that they have become much more enticing to bet as they moved closer toward being a \u201creal\u201d bluff because we only have one card to come. The non-heart draws have, on average, 28.43% equity or less, which is why they are bluffed more often. It\u2019s a much better result for these hands to get folds. We still don\u2019t mind going to the river more frequently with our combo draws.\nOnce again, let\u2019s look at the response to the most common bet size of 33% pot:\n Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs \n\n Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs \n\nBTN response vs UTG\u2019s 33% pot delayed c-bet\nThere is still a significant amount of raising, although a bit less than there was on the flop. The same sort of hands fold but at a higher frequency\u2014trash, small pocket pairs, and weak Ace-x.\nWith one card to come, this is a much better outcome for our combo draws, even more so since there are even a few hands that continue that our higher card bluffs beat. We can \u201cbluff\u201d with A\u2665K\u2665 and A\u2665Q\u2665 and still get called by worse straight draws like A5s, A4s, KQs, K9s, and worse flush draws.\nWhat if We Brick?\nOne last thing to explore: what happens when we get called on the turn and a brick falls on the river? I have made the river a 2\u2666 which is the card perhaps least likely to have helped either player.\nThis is the first-in river action from UTG:\n Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs \n\n Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs \n\nUTG delayed double-barrel river strategy vs BTN on J\u2665T\u26652\u2663 3\u2660 2\u2666 (after turn went B33-C)\nAnd once again, let\u2019s compare the checking frequencies to determine which of our combo draws bluff when they miss:\n Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs \n\nOnce again, our missed flush draws check the most (i.e., they bluff the least); twice as often as the other suits, in fact.\nThis is a very useful heuristic to note:\nMissed straight draws make better bluffs on the river than missed flush draws, most of the time.\nThe reason is simple: when you\u2019re bluffing, you hope that your opponent folds. Their folding range usually contains a lot of missed flush draws, but by having a flush draw yourself, you reduce the likelihood they\u2019ll fold. A missed straight draw, on the other hand, interferes less with the folding range, making it relatively more likely they\u2019ll fold.\nLet\u2019s look at the response to the 132% pot bet:\n Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs \n\n Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs \n\nBTN response vs UTG\u2019s 132% pot bet delayed double-barrel\nKQs bluffs all the time, regardless of suit; it makes for a very good bluff. It makes Ace-x and small pocket pairs fold, which is a great result. It also blocks AKo, QQ, KJs, QJs, KTs, and QTs, which all continue in some capacity.\nIn contrast, 87s bluffs half the time except when it is 8\u26657\u2665. A hand like 8\u26667\u2666 makes a good bluff because it\u2019s almost never ahead, so any hand it makes fold was otherwise winning. It crucially unblocks missed heart draws, all of which will fold. 8\u26657\u2665 takes a lot of heart draws out of the BTN\u2019s range, weighting them more towards a bluff-catcher or stronger.\nA quick look at the \u201cBlockers\u201d tab shows us this:\n Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs \n\nThe 8\u2665 and 7\u2665 are both among the cards that lower the BTN\u2019s folding frequency by the greatest amount.\nIn contrast, this is the same tab for the K and Q:\n Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs \n\nIn some instances, having either of these cards increases the chance the BTN will fold, and even for the heart variant, the decrease in fold likelihood is quite low.\nSummary\nThis was just one hand, but it nicely summarizes what I have been observing for the last three or four months as I fixed this semi-bluffing leak of mine.\n      * It\u2019s tempting to go all guns blazing when you have a massive draw because it is often unexploitable, and you get to put your money in as an equity favorite and give the opponent a tough decision.\n      * Big combo draws, however, are actually so strong that they often consider it a pity to take the pot down immediately on the flop.\n      * Bluffs, by definition, are weaker hands that are happy to take a pot down uncontested. On the flop and turn, it still helps to have outs when called, but they should also be hands that are easy to fold when raised.\n      * Even though it sucks when you play such a promising hand more passively and then don\u2019t hit any of your outs by the river, you have to be disciplined not to bluff off your stack because there are often better bluffs available in your range.\nThe Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nOne of the great modern debates in poker is GTO vs Exploitative strategy. It can be a surprisingly polarizing discussion, with each strategic methodology having devout adherents who dismiss the other.\nIn reality, GTO and Exploitative poker are two sides of the same coin.\n      * Rational exploitative players use GTO as a means to identify leaks and as a baseline strategy to deviate from as an exploit to said leaks.\n      * GTO strategy, on the flip side, is informed by potential exploits that could be used against it. It develops with the goal of avoiding unnecessary losses.\nExploitative poker is a more offensive, dynamic style that attacks vulnerabilities but does so by exposing vulnerabilities itself. The reason to fight with an open visor is that it allows to inflict greater damage and, therefore, can produce a higher win rate. However, more rewards usually come with more risk! In this case, the potential of counterexploitation. GTO poker is a more defensive, static style in the sense that it\u2019s built around the notion of minimizing leaks as if covered by full-body armor, but the upside is capped. The reward is that it is reliably effective regardless of the opposing strategy. Note that \u2018defensive\u2019 does not imply passive. GTO can be very aggressive in its aim to conserve as much EV as possible.\n ICM and Blind Battles: The Small Blind \n\nThe whole point I\u2019m trying to make is that:\nOne can not truly understand one style of poker without understanding the other.\nToday, we are going to highlight the five fundamental imbalances in poker that inform exploitative strategy. Every leak a player has will fall into one of these categories.\nThe five fundamental imbalances in poker are:\n      * Betting Volume \u2013 The amount of money that is put into each possible line.\n      * Equity management \u2013 The amount of equity that is put into each possible line.\n      * Polarity \u2013 The extent to which a range is polarized between strong and weak hands.\n      * Elasticity \u2013 How sensitive and adaptive someone is to bet sizing.\n      * Board coverage \u2013 How well someone constructs their range in terms of the interaction with boards and board runouts.\nExploitative poker is about incentives. As we go through this list, think about how these imbalances give you incentives/reasons to lean into certain exploits.\n1) Betting Volume\nBetting volume refers to:\nThe aggregate amount of money that is bet in a certain node or series of nodes (line).\nBetting Volume = \u2211 (Bet Frequency \u00d7 Bet Sizing)\nExploitative frameworks analyze the opponent\u2019s strategy through the lens of betting volume: where does my opponent put the most money? A betting volume mistake is simply when someone puts too much (or too little) money in on a particular betting (or raising) line. When we categorize a player as a nit, a calling station, or a maniac, we are doing so based on a betting volume error.\nWherever an opponent\u2019s betting volume is highest is where you want to deploy your value, especially your nutted hands. Generally speaking, your nutted hands dictate your strategy, including exploitative strategy:\n      * Exploit vs over-bluffing \u2013 Checking with your value to slow-play or to check/raise.\n      * Exploit vs over-callers \u2013 Betting thinner for value and sizing up with nutted hands.\n      * Exploit vs over-folders \u2013 Sizing down or checking with nutted hands to avoid scaring them away too quickly and thus losing out on value. Bluffing performs better now too, due to the increased fold equity.\nLet\u2019s jump into a simple example to make things practical. We are going to use the same hand example for each type of imbalance in this article. This is BB vs CO, single-raised pot, 60bb starting stacks on a flop of 9\u26656\u26664\u2663.\nThe BB checks 100% of the time and this CO\u2019s equilibrium strategy:\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nCO c-bet flop (GTO) strategy on 964r vs BB\nThere is a mix of checking and betting. The bet sizes mix, but they are mostly overbets or large bets, with only a small amount of 33% pot betting.\nThe CO\u2019s EV is 3.7bb in GTO World. If we hover over a specific hand (e.g., T9s), these are the EVs of every line:\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nExpected values for all actions for all combinations of T9s: GTO\nT9s mostly overbets but mixes all its actions because the EVs of doing so are basically the same.\nBut what if the BB has a betting volume leak?\nWe\u2019ll lock the hand so that the BB never folds to the 33% pot bet. This is a player who thinks such a small bet is \u2018weak,\u2019 and the person who made it can be outplayed later in the hand. We changed the frequency of folding to zero and let GTO Wizard AI decide how the range calls or raises:\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nBB\u2019s nodelocked (by frequency) response vs CO\u2019s 33% pot c-bet\nWe also locked the 100% check at the start of the hand. You\u2019ll know why if you read our Limits of Nodelocking article. With all that information in mind, let\u2019s see what effect this has on the CO\u2019s c-betting strategy:\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nCO\u2019s c-bet flop (exploitative) strategy on 964r vs BB\nThe CO has gone from a mixed strategy, which rarely bets small, to betting small 100% of the time. Even very strong hands like sets and overpairs have gone for the small sizing.\nRevisiting T9s specifically shows an average EV of ~7.2bb for overbetting, but the average EV of betting 33% pot is even higher at ~8.6bb.\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nExpected values for all actions for all combinations of T9s: Exploitative\nThere is a clear betting volume error here! \u274c The BB is putting too much money in against the 33% pot bet line, so the CO is incentivized to use that sizing for their entire range. The no-fold vs bet dynamic allows them to grow the pot they are favored to win on the flop without losing practically any of their advantages on the turn (depending on the new card). Even very weak hands like J5s are beating enough of the BB\u2019s calling range to justify doing this. Bear in mind that this is despite the fact that the BB will pay off overbets. Even the very strong hands that normally are incentivized to overbet, like overpairs and top pair, are choosing the small bet line because they are guaranteed to be called.\nAt the start of the hand, the CO makes 3.75bb in GTO world, but with the nodelocked strategy, they make 4.71bb overall, which is a significant increase.\n2) Equity Management\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nEquity management in poker refers to:\nHow a player manages all their possible hands, which come from a varying set of equity buckets.\nThis topic can be divided into two parts:\n      * Nut allocation \u2013 What do they do with their nutted, high-equity hands?\nDo they bet small, do they overbet, or do they check? Do they bluff with their lowest-equity hands or turn made hands into bluffs?\n      * Hand appraisal \u2013 How do they value different hand classes?\nSome players play top pair the same way others play a set. Some players massively overvalue Ace-x type hands or have a fondness for small suited connectors. There are players who will be quite nitty with top pair, but happy to commit everything with a high-equity draw.\nAn equity management error would be over- or under-valuing a certain hand class. Classic practical examples of this include over-calling with weak pairs or missing thin value.\nLet\u2019s go back to that 9\u26656\u26664\u2663 hand. When the CO does overbet, this is the BB\u2019s GTO response:\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nBB\u2019s (GTO) response vs CO\u2019s 125% pot c-bet\nThere is a small (~6%) check/raising range. The value is mostly top pair or two pair, the bluffs are mostly gutshots or backdoor draws. Sets just call, as do the open-ended straight draws.\nAn equity management error would be over-bluffing in this spot. Let\u2019s nodelock this so that the BB check/raises their open-ended straight draws 100% of the time, and their gutshots or backdoor draws 50% of the time.\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nBB\u2019s (nodelocked: semi-bluff-heavy) response vs CO\u2019s 125% pot c-bet\nThey now raise ~23% of the time. If you are following along in GTO Wizard itself, remember to lock the range first. Otherwise the solver will increase the number of hands that check/raise for value to compensate for the imbalance.\nLet\u2019s compare how the response changed to optimize against this check/raise, which is now way heavier in semi-bluffs. This is the CO\u2019s original GTO response:\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nCO\u2019s (GTO) response vs BB\u2019s balanced check/raise\nThis is how CO reacts in the nodelocked simulation:\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nCO\u2019s (exploitative) response vs BB\u2019s imbalanced check/raise\nIn GTO world, the CO should fold ~38% of the time, but in the nodelocked solution, folding is out of the question. They are not incentivized to call either, exclusively raising to exploit the range with too many bluffs in it. Two raise sizes are used, with the shoves being heavier on top pair and the non-all-in raising range skewing toward second pair.\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nRange breakdowns: left = Raise 124% (all-in), right = Raise 66%\nIn the GTO example, the CO\u2019s raises are carefully picked. When it is 9-x, it is either A9 or K9, which outkick many pairs of 9-x that call, or T9s/98s/97s, which can all make straights or flushes by the river. The bluffs are broadway overcards like JTs and QTs, which can make runner-runner straights or flushes and also have pair outs against 9-x. In the nodelocked example, we just raise pretty much everything because the BB\u2019s range is too bluff-heavy. This is a recurring theme in exploitative poker strategy:\nWhen your opponent is very out of balance, the need to carefully curate your own range to maintain a delicate balance disappears as well.\nMost of the time, you can just do what your hand is incentivized to do.\n         * At the start of the hand, the CO makes ~3.7bb on average in GTO World.\n         * In this nodelocked example, they make ~4.5bb on average.\n3) Polarity\nPolarity in poker refers to:\nThe degree to which a range is polarized between strong and weak hands or more condensed toward middling hands.\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nA polarity imbalance essentially refers to not understanding range morphology and using the incorrect strategy for the shapes of the ranges. Is your opponent representing a polarized range with lots of nuts and bluffs or a more merged range with lots of medium-strength hands and draws?\nHaving a capped range but taking the betting lead would be an example of this imbalance. Betting small with a polarized range or overbetting with a condensed range would be another example.\nThe exploit for a polarity imbalance depends on the direction of the imbalance:\n         * If an opponent has a capped or too condensed range, you should attack that range with big sizings because that\u2019s how you extract the most value from such a range.\n         * If your opponent has a too polarized range, you want to attack them with small bet sizes because polar ranges struggle to call, so a small bet will force them to raise or over-fold.\nWith the caveat that if they are perfectly polarized (they only have the nuts or a pure bluff) you do not want to attack them. Instead, you should bluff-catch against them because otherwise, they will only continue against you with the nuts.\nOnce again, looking at that 9\u26656\u26664\u2663 hand. A reminder that this is the CO response to a check at equilibrium:\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nCO c-bet (GTO) flop strategy on 964r vs BB\nAround 42% of hands check. Some top pair hands check for protection, but mostly, the checking range is made up of lower pairs and Ace-high. A hand like 86s currently has good equity but preserves less of it against the calling range, so it is incentivized to check.\nA polarity error here would be for the CO to range-bet with its rather polarized range. This is a common mistake, especially by players from the early days of online who were once able to auto-profit by c-betting every flop purely. This is how the solver adjusts CO\u2019s strategy when we take away the option to check:\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nCO\u2019s adjusted c-bet flop strategy when check is not allowed\nIn the below node comparison, the BB\u2019s responses to the overbet are contrasted:\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nBB responses facing an overbet: exploitative (left) vs GTO (right)\nThe first thing to note is that there is significantly less folding in the nodelocked example. The BB folds ~48% of the time compared to ~58% of the time. The other notable difference is the doubling of the check/raising frequency. This is a common combination of exploits:\nWhen somebody bets too often, you are incentivized to let them make that mistake, and then either bluff-catch wider or pounce with extra check/raises.\nAt the start of the hand, the BB has a theoretical EV of ~2.1bb. In the nodelocked example, they make ~2.2bb in exploitative EV. Not a huge increase, but magnified over a large sample it is a ~10bb/100 error.\n4) Elasticity\nElasticity in poker refers to:\nHow sensitive and adaptive a player is to bet sizing, aka pricing.\nHigh elasticity means they are very sensitive to pricing, and low elasticity means they are insensitive to pricing.\nA satellite winner playing their first ever WSOP Main Event might be too elastic to pricing and over-fold because of fear of busting out. Indeed, every year, amateurs discuss the merits of folding AA preflop in the first level if another player goes all-in. The fear of busting is so great that it trumps the massive +EV proposition of getting $10,000 in the middle as a more than 80% favorite. This is the quintessential \u2018scared money\u2019 stereotype.\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nA wealthy player gambling at stakes that are too low for them is a classic example of a player with a too inelastic leak. These players will call all-ins with any two cards for fun and are immune to bluffing.\nYou know the drill by now, let\u2019s get out that 9\u26656\u26664\u2663 board once more. This was the CO response vs a balanced check from BB:\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nCO c-bet (GTO) flop strategy on 964r vs BB\nThis is a classic overbetting spot because the CO has a polarized range. They either have a very strong hand relative to this flop (top pair or better) or have missed this flop completely.\nThis is what the BB should do when the overbet is made:\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nBB\u2019s (GTO) response vs CO\u2019s 125% pot c-bet\nPlenty of folding, but the BB has to call with hands as weak as Ace-high to avoid being exploited.\nWhat if, however, the BB is over-sensitive to pricing and would never call an overbet with second pair or lower?\nThis is what the CO does when checked to on the flop when we lock in the above leak:\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nCO c-bet (exploitative) flop strategy on 964r vs (over-sensitive: over-fold to 125% pot) BB\nThe CO has gone from betting ~58% of the time to betting ~76% of the time. They have also stopped using the 82% bet size altogether. Their overbetting frequency jumped up from 52% to 66% of the time.\nWith BB being over-sensitive to pricing, expressed as over-folding to overbets, CO is incentivized to increase the frequency of overbets.\nA more curious adjustment is that the 33% bet size also sees an increase in frequency (from 3% to 9%). This is because some hands in the range really do not want the BB to over-fold. In particular, the sets adopt this strategy when they overbet a lot of the time at equilibrium. 99, for example, makes around 14.5bb whether it is checked, small bet, or overbet in the unlocked GTO solution. In this nodelocked example, it only makes ~10.5bb as an overbet but ~13.8bb as a small bet.\nLet\u2019s switch gears and observe what happens when we model the BB as price-insensitive by having them call any pair and Ace-high too.\nThis is a gambler that over-calls to overbets. Given the assumed elasticity error, this is how the CO plays after they check flop:\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nCO c-bet (exploitative) flop strategy on 964r vs (price-insensitive) BB\nThe frequency of betting has not significantly changed from the GTO example, but now the betting range is exclusively overbet. If Villain is not folding to the biggest bet size, we may as well use that size with all our value.\n            * In the GTO example, at the start of the hand, the BB made ~2.1bb on average.\n            * In both nodelocked examples, they made ~1.85bb in the price-sensitive example and ~1.8bb in the price-insensitive example.\n5) Board Coverage\nBoard coverage in poker refers to\nThe ability to make strong hands across a wide range of possible board textures.\nBalanced ranges have board coverage, meaning they can potentially hit any flop. Most opening ranges contain most of the suited Ace-x hands, such as A3s, because they are an economical way to achieve board coverage. A tight opening range can still hit a 3\u26652\u26663\u2666 flop because it was constructed with board coverage in mind.\nBoard coverage isn\u2019t limited to the flop; it also has an aspect of runout coverage. An easy-to-digest example is when there is a potential flush draw on the flop. We want to have flush draws both when we check and when we bet, so when the turn brings a flush-completing card, we can represent it in both scenarios.\nA board coverage error is made when a line is over- or under-saturated with certain types of hands. When a player never c-bets with Ace-high on the flop, they should generate fewer folds when they barrel on a turned Ace. When a player never checks back a pair, they can more easily be pushed off a hand when the turn pairs the board.\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nOh look who it is, it\u2019s that 9\u26656\u26664\u2663 hand from earlier. In the unlikely case you forgot, here\u2019s a reminder of the GTO flop strategy for the CO when checked to:\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nLet\u2019s say the flop goes check-check, and the turn is an A\u2660. This is the first action from the BB:\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nBB\u2019s (GTO) first in turn strategy vs CO\u2019s flop check\nThere is a small amount of leading because the CO has weakened their range by checking, but most of the time, the BB checks again.\nWhat if we updated the CO\u2019s c-bet strategy so that they always bluffed with Ace-high, at a variety of sizings?\nWhen the flop checks through now and the A\u2660 turn comes, the BB\u2019s adjustment looks as follows:\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\n The Five Imbalances of Exploitative Poker \n\nBB\u2019s (exploitative) first in turn strategy vs CO\u2019s nodelocked flop check\nThe BB has gone from leading 6% of the time to leading 70% of the time. Why?\nBy betting all of their Ace-x on the flop, the checking CO has a capped turn-range when the Ace shows on fourth street. In the GTO example, the CO checked a lot of Ace-x hands on the flop, which gave them runout coverage for an Ace coming on the turn. However, in this example, the BB knows the CO cannot have top pair, so they punish them by betting a lot.\nThe issues caused by a board coverage error manifest when the under-represented board card is dealt. In the example above, when the Ace turns up, the CO is unable to represent that card, so much so that the BB can attack with leads around 70% of the time. Alternatively, the CO loses the implied odds when they hit the Ace on the turn when the flop goes check-bet-call, because now they have too many Ace-x hands, and will not get paid off.\nThis is why we mix our actions, so we can represent value (and bluffs) on every possible runout in every possible line.\nBoard coverage imbalances give attentive players a form of clairvoyance that allows them to tell when a card has (or has not) improved their opponent.\n            * In GTO world, on the turn, the CO makes ~3.8bb on average.\n            * In the nodelocked example, their expected value drops to ~2.4bb.\nConclusion\nThis is a starting guide to exploitative poker. Any leak you notice at the table, every play that deviates from GTO, will have one of these imbalances. Of course, it could be the case that a player has multiple imbalances at the same time. A tight player may under-bluff (see equity management) and not have any low suited Ace-x hands like A3s (see board coverage). A loose player might always c-bet every board, even the ones where they have a polarized range (see polarity) and never fold to reraises (see (in)elasticity).\nThe nodelocking feature of GTO Wizard AI will show you how to adapt to these players. It can also show you what the EV is of a line in a GTO context compared to playing against the specific suboptimal opponent that you modeled. The severity of an error is really worth paying attention to, as we have seen above, some errors are more costly than others.\nIf you found this topic interesting, Tombos21 covered it in more depth and explored more themes in the following video:\nThe Art of Bluff Catching\n The Art of Bluff Catching \n\nBluff catching\u2014calling a bet with a modest hand which you expect to win only if your opponent is bluffing\u2014is not a significant source of profit in most situations. It is often a roughly breakeven proposition against a well-constructed betting range, and even when it is profitable, it tends to be only by a slim margin.\nBluff catching is not a significant source of profit.\nMuch of the strategy in big bet poker games like No-Limit Hold\u2019em and Pot Limit Omaha revolves around not ending up in spots where you\u2019re making decisions about whether to call or fold with a bluff catcher in the first place. If you\u2019re torn between calling and folding, then the EV of both options must be similar, which means your hand is basically worthless no matter which you choose.\nIn this article, we will investigate why bluff catching is so unappealing, how to handle bluff catching decisions when you end up in a tough spot, and how to avoid ending up in that tough spot in the first place.\nWhen Bluff Catching is Worthless\nPerhaps you\u2019ve heard of the AKQ game (sometimes called the Clairvoyance Game). In this toy game, both players are dealt a single card from a deck containing one Ace, one King, and one Queen. They ante and are allowed to bet as they could in a real poker game. If the hand goes to showdown, the player with the highest card wins.\nBecause hands never change value in this game, it is analogous to playing the river in hold \u2018em. By analyzing how bluff catching works in this game and how much it is (not) worth, we can better understand bluff catching on the river in real poker situations. Then we can work backwards to think about bluff catching on earlier streets.\n Counterintuitive Calls \n\nFirst, let\u2019s think about the decisions you could face holding each card in the AKQ game:\n            * Queen \u2013 This is the nut low. It will never win at showdown. You would never call a bet with this hopeless hand. The only decision is whether to bluff or resign yourself to losing at showdown.\n            * Ace \u2013 This is the nuts. When in position, you always bet. But even with the nuts, you can face a tricky decision when out of position. You could bet, hoping your opponent will call with a bluff catcher, or check, hoping they will bluff.\n            * King \u2013 This is your bluff catcher. That doesn\u2019t mean you should definitely call bets with it, but calling is a legitimate option with a chance of winning the pot. What you should never do with this hand, however, is bet it. Unless your opponent fundamentally misunderstands the game, they will never fold the nuts nor call with the nut low, so betting accomplishes nothing.\nSo, you get one easy decision with a bluff catcher (King): you always check it. If you are last to act, there\u2019s nothing to worry about. You go straight to showdown and find out whether your hand is good. If not, you may have a tough decision if your opponent bets, but they are not necessarily going to bet, so you sometimes get a free showdown even after checking (and always win since your opponent would never check an Ace).\n How to solve toy games \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in the details, the GTO Wizard blog has an entire article dedicated to solving variations of this game. The bottom line is that there is no correct answer whether to bluff with a Queen or bluff catch with a King. The GTO/unexploitable strategy for both hands is a mix of both options. With a King, the strategy is to always check and to call bets to reach Minimum Defense Frequency\u2014a frequency of calls that makes your opponent indifferent to bluffing.\nAn unexploitable GTO strategy is not intrinsically profitable. It could even be money-losing!\nIt is essential to understand that these calls are not intrinsically profitable. They could even be money-losing! These calls\u2019 profitability\u2014or lack thereof\u2014depends on your opponent\u2019s bluffing frequency. If they bluff too much, your calls are profitable. If they don\u2019t bluff enough, these calls lose money (but you make up the difference elsewhere by sometimes winning at showdown when you would have folded to a bluff).\nThis unexploitable calling frequency is the optimal strategy only when you have no insight into how your opponent will play.\nThe fact that you are mixing between calls and folds means the two must have the same EV, which must be $0 since that is always the EV of folding (in a Chip EV environment). This is why bluff catching is worthless: even if your opponent bluffs when they\u2019re supposed to, and you get your calling frequency precisely right, you still don\u2019t make any more money than you would have if you had folded.\nBluff Catching on the River\nIn real hold \u2018em situations, this dynamic is easiest to see on the river. Here\u2019s an example where BB calls a raise from UTG in a 100bb cash game, checks and calls 76% pot on the A\u2665T\u26666\u2665 flop and 125% pot on the 4\u2660 turn, then checks and faces an all-in bet for just over 200% pot on the 2\u2665 river.\n The Art of Bluff Catching \n\nBoxes appear on this grid as either fully green for hands which always call, fully blue for hands which always fold, or a mix of blue and green for hands which sometimes call and sometimes fold. That \u201csometimes\u201d can mean one of two things: it may be that the hand either purely calls or purely folds depending on suits, or it may be that the hand is indifferent between calling and folding\u2014the equivalent of a K in the AKQ game.\nThe pure calls\u2014the ones that are profitable rather than breakeven bluff catchers\u2014are mostly flushes. The T9s and T8s that call are flushes, not second pair. T6s, which makes two pair, is a pure fold.\nThere are some pure calls from other hands, though it\u2019s tough to tell from the grid. A9 and AT always fold without a heart but always call when they have one:\n The Art of Bluff Catching \n\nThis is not true for all the Ace-x, however. AQ always folds without the Q\u2665 but is indifferent with it:\n The Art of Bluff Catching \n\nThe above grid shows Call with an EV of .01, but that\u2019s just a convergence error. If calling were actually more profitable than folding, even by a tiny fraction, the solver would call every time.\nNot even all flushes are profitable bluff catchers. Check out the strategy for 5\u2665 3\u2665:\n The Art of Bluff Catching \n\nNot even all flushes are profitable bluff catchers.\nWhat\u2019s going on here? Why is the solver folding some two pair and sometimes even a flush but calling with some top pair?\nWhen Bluffcatching is Worthwhile\nThree factors could make calling this river shove profitable rather than breakeven:\n            * You expect to beat some of UTG\u2019s value bets. In this case, your hand is not even technically a bluff catcher because the value of the call doesn\u2019t only come from beating bluffs. With a pure bluff catcher, the sort that\u2019s indifferent to calling, the money you expect to win from bluffs is exactly equal to the money you expect to lose to value bets. When you call with J\u2665 4\u2665, you aren\u2019t a lock to win, but you will win more, on average, than you lose because you beat all the bluffs plus the occasional lower flush.\n            * You block more value hands than bluffs. When UTG shoves, they either have a flush or they are bluffing. This is why top pair is not necessarily worse for calling than two pair, a set or even a low flush. All these hands beat bluffs equally well and lose to all the same flushes. When you hold the T\u2665, however, you have secret information. You know your opponent does not hold T\u2665 8\u2665, but they do not know you know that. They therefore bluff at a higher frequency, as if they could have T\u2665 8\u2665 and similar hands. You profit from all those bluffs while knowing you won\u2019t be shown the value hands as often as you would with a worse bluff catcher.\n            * You expect your opponent to bluff too often. To make your bluff catchers indifferent to calling, your opponent must bluff exactly in proportion to the pot odds their bet offers. If they bluff too much, all your bluff catches become (slightly) profitable. If they bluff too little, then you lose money by bluff catching.\n Flop Heuristics: OOP C-Betting in MTTs \n\nThis third point is exploitative in nature. It requires you to wager on a belief about your opponent\u2019s strategy. If your belief is correct, you do better than you would with an unexploitable calling strategy. If it is incorrect, you do worse.\nYou won\u2019t always be able to make such a prediction, but when you are, it can easily override the first two points. If your opponent does not bluff enough, you could lose money not only by calling with pure bluff catchers, but even by calling with hands that have good blocking effects or that beat a few hands they thought they were betting for value.\nThis is because bluff catching, even when you have the ideal catcher against an opponent who bluffs perfectly, is just not that profitable. The best-case scenario usually gains EV equal to only a tiny fraction of what you risk on the call.\nYou also are not guaranteed profitable bluff catches, even at equilibrium, just because you meet the above criteria. Remember that AQ with the Q\u2665, in our example, mixed calls and folds despite blocking some value hands. This was partly because it also blocked some bluffs\u2014the Q\u2665 is also a good blocker for UTG to hold when they bluff. Blockers are often easy enough to come by and have a marginal enough effect that an equilibrium bluffing strategy makes you indifferent to calling when you have them and strictly prefer folding when you don\u2019t.\nBluff Catching Before the River\nThe biggest difference between real poker and the AKQ game is that hands can change value from street to street. Before the river, this is often the most important factor when considering whether to call with a bluff catcher: could this hand improve to something nutty?\nThis comes back to the idea that you want to avoid ending up in a marginal spot where you\u2019re making decisions about whether to call or fold with a bluff catcher. You don\u2019t want a K in the AKQ game; you want an A. Sometimes, in pursuit of an A, you end up with a K. When that happens, you must make the best of it. But the chance of improving to an A is worth a lot.\nCould this hand improve to something nutty?\nHere is BB\u2019s turn strategy facing a 125% pot bet on A\u2665T\u26666\u26654\u2660:\n The Art of Bluff Catching \n\nWith the exception of AQ and AK, which beat some value hands, top pair is indifferent between calling and folding. Nut flush draws always fold unless they have a straight draw as well. Yet lower flush draws with a pair like 5\u2665 4\u2665 and Q\u2665 T\u2665 never fold. Despite being lower ranked and having worse blockers than A9, these hands always call (or raise). Neither the draw nor the bluff catching value alone is enough to make calling profitable. It is the combination of improving to a flush or showing down the best hand unimproved that gets these hands over the line.\nIn fact, BB starts folding top pair as early as the flop when they don\u2019t have a significant redraw to go along with it. Notice that A5 is indifferent to calling the 76% pot continuation bet unless it also has a backdoor flush draw:\n The Art of Bluff Catching \n\nYou may be more familiar with this concept than you realize. Suppose you\u2019re on the button preflop, facing a raise from UTG. Would you rather call with 87s or K7o? It could go the other way if the bet were all-in, but with money behind, you probably prefer the 87s. K7o is a (slightly) above-average hand preflop, but it rarely turns into anything nutty. It often misses the flop entirely, and when it does hit, it makes tough-to-play hands like bottom pair or top pair with a bad kicker. 87s may be the lower-ranked hand, but its potential to turn into a straight or flush makes it a better candidate for playing after the flop.\nIt is never too soon to fold top pair.\nThe same principle applies when you\u2019re facing flop and turn bets. The more money remaining to be wagered, the more you should concern yourself with what the hand could turn into on later streets rather than its current rank. Contrary to popular belief, there is no prize for being ahead on the flop, nor is it \u201ctoo soon\u201d to fold top pair.\nPractical Bluff Catching\n How ICM Impacts Restealing From The Blinds \n\nWhat makes these two cards good for calling?\n            * Start with a rough sense of how often you ought to continue. This is primarily a function of the bet size relative to the pot\u2014you should be more stubborn facing smaller bets\u2014and range dynamics. If you started with a weaker range than your opponent because of the action on earlier streets, then it is correct to fold more often. You may wish to factor in exploitative assumptions here as well. If you think your opponent will rarely bluff, then you should fold more often.\n            * Identify your never-folds. These are mostly either hands strong enough to beat some of your opponent\u2019s value bets, or draws to nutty hands, though as we have seen, the draws alone may not be sufficient when facing large bets. You may call or raise with these hands\u2014both \u201cpunish\u201d your opponent\u2019s bluffs\u2014but you know you are not folding them.\n            * Identify additional bluff catching candidates as needed. If (and only if) the hands you identified in Step Two do not get you up to the point you wanted to be in Step One, then you search for additional bluff catchers. Look for hands with good blocking effects or potential to improve on future streets. Ideally, a combination of both.\n            * Gut check. Before you click \u2018call\u2018 or push chips into the pot, articulate to yourself why you are calling with this hand. Your answer should not be something generic like \u201cmy opponent could be bluffing\u201d because that\u2019s got nothing to do with your cards. It\u2019s a reason you should have a calling range, but it doesn\u2019t tell you anything about whether your current hand belongs in that range. What makes these two cards good for calling?\nPlanning Ahead\n Delayed C-Betting \n\nThe \u201cgut check\u201d described in Step Four above is especially valuable because it can help with future bluff catching decisions. For instance, when you articulate why you are calling the turn, you also plan ahead for the river.\nWhen you articulate why you are calling the turn, you also plan ahead for the river.\nLet\u2019s return to that A\u2665 T\u2666 6\u2665 4\u2660 board again. When you call the turn with Q\u2665 T\u2665, you are looking for one of two things. First, you are looking for a river card that helps you. A flush would be ideal, but even a Queen or Ten would give you enough equity to call a river bet. Second, you are looking for your opponent to check behind. If they do, you will occasionally win unimproved. If neither of those things happens\u2014if you whiff the river and your opponent bets again\u2014then you fold.\nSure, it\u2019s possible your opponent could be bluffing. But remember that you have different hands in your range to choose from, hands that did improve on this river or have better blockers, to pick off those bluffs. This hand\u2019s job is not to catch those bluffs. This hand\u2019s job is to dodge value bets by folding.\nOr, consider A\u2666 5\u2666 on the flop. Why are you calling the flop bet with this hand? \u201cBecause I have top pair\u201d is not a helpful answer. It tells you nothing about what you will do on later streets. You\u2019re calling because you might pick up a diamond draw on the turn, or your opponent might check the turn, or they might bet small enough for your blocker to be relevant. If none of those things happens\u2014if you whiff and your opponent overbets\u2014then you fold even though they could easily be bluffing.\n Playing Limped Pots as the SB in MTTs \n\nOne of the ways you catch bluffs is by re-bluffing.\nLet\u2019s try one more. Why is J\u2665 8\u2665 calling the flop? First and foremost, it\u2019s hoping for some improvement on the turn. A heart would be ideal, but picking up a pair or even a straight draw will probably be enough to call another bet. Failing those things, it\u2019s hoping for a check so it can either improve on the river or bluff.\nThat\u2019s right: one of the ways you \u201ccatch\u201d bluffs is by re-bluffing. That could mean raising the current street or calling and bluffing later, should the right circumstances occur. Bluffing is not especially profitable, but then again, neither is bluff catching.\nThis is yet another reason why a good draw with a backup plan of bluffing is better than a marginal made hand that will rarely be useful for anything but bluff catching on later streets. Either way, your backup plan isn\u2019t worth much. At least the draw has the potential to turn into something valuable.\nConclusion\nBluff catching is not primarily about the rank of your hand. The only reason a hand would be \u201ctoo strong to fold\u201d would be if it beats hands your opponent could be value betting. If your opponent\u2019s range is polarized around your hand\u2014if you lose to all their value bets and beat all their bluffs\u2014then your top pair catches bluffs just as well as sets do.\nOn the river, bluff catching decisions mostly come down to what you block or unblock.\nBefore the river, a hand\u2019s potential to improve is a major factor, to such a degree that draws are sometimes better calling candidates than top pair!\nBut reads can trump all of these considerations. Before you worry about blockers and Minimum Defense Frequency, consider whether you even want to bluff catch against this player in this spot. The best-case scenarios are rarely very profitable, and in the worst-case scenarios, calling big river bets with bluff catchers is lighting money on fire.\nIf you\u2019re not careful, everything you learn about game theory, blockers, and exploitability can be twisted into excuses for fishy calls. You should be at least as worried about whether calling is exploitable, as you are about whether folding is exploitable.\nNavigating Nasty Rivers Out of Position\n Navigating Nasty Rivers as OOP \n\nPlaying out of position (OOP) is hard. It\u2019s fundamentally disadvantageous to act on each street without knowing your opponent\u2019s action while they get to act with knowledge of yours. This disadvantage is especially acute on dynamic rivers. When the final community card makes new monster hands possible, it also devalues previously strong holdings. Hands with which you were happily growing the pot on the flop and turn may suddenly prefer a cheap showdown.\nUnfortunately, to get that cheap showdown, you have to check or bet small, which risks telegraphing your desire to your opponent. They can then bet or raise a polarized range, leaving you in a pickle. Game theory is not a magic bullet solution to this difficulty. Solvers lose money out of position just like humans do. But they lose as little as possible because they can balance their ranges to minimize the information they leak with their actions.\nIn this article, we will investigate how solvers strike this balance and extrapolate heuristics to help you better handle these extremely tricky situations.\nPrevention > Treatment\nThe best way to handle a messy situation is to avoid ending up in it in the first place. When you foresee a tough spot on the horizon, the best way to minimize the damage is to keep the pot small.\nHow do solvers avoid messy situations?\n1) Tight opening ranges from Early Position\nTight opening ranges from Early Position, emphasizing suited hands. One pair is the hand class most susceptible to getting \u201cshipwrecked\u201d by a bad river card. Suited starting hands still turn into one pair more often than they turn into anything else, but they at least have the potential to make a flush. This UTG opening range from a 9-handed 100bb cash game illustrates how solvers open only the very best offsuit hands from early position but are more liberal with suited (and, to a lesser extent, connected) hands:\n Navigating Nasty Rivers as OOP \n\nUTG opening range in a 9-handed, 100bb cash game\n2) Rarely flatting open-raises in Early Position\nRarely flatting open-raises in Early Position. A \u201cno-flop, no-drop\u201c rake structure is the biggest incentive for aggressive 3-betting in cash games. But even in an unraked game, solvers rarely call raises in early position and prefer suited hands when they do so. Calls invite players with better position to squeeze or call behind you, forcing you to play out of position after the flop. Here\u2019s a HJ strategy facing a 2bb LJ open in an unraked, 100bb cash game:\n Navigating Nasty Rivers as OOP \n\nHJ defense vs LJ 2bb open-raise in an unraked, 100bb cash game\n3) Rarely c-betting from OOP\nRarely c-betting from out of position. This LJ vs BTN 100bb cash game single-raised pot (SRP) flop report shows LJ c-betting less than \u2153 of the time on aggregate with a strong preference for betting on less connected flops:\n Navigating Nasty Rivers as OOP \n\n Navigating Nasty Rivers as OOP \n\nLJ vs BTN in a 100bb cash game SRP: LJ\u2019s average flop action frequencies + tendencies based on Connectedness\nWhen OOP on a dynamic board, you may not be favored to win the pot, even when you flop a strong hand.\nSome of this is a function of how the equity is distributed on various flop textures, but it also reflects the fact that growing pots, even with currently strong hands, is more dangerous on connected boards where a new card could more easily devalue your hand. Because you can anticipate being disadvantaged on many river decisions, you may not be favored to win the pot, even when you flop a strong hand.\nFlush draws on the flop have a similar but less dramatic effect on OOP\u2019s c-betting strategy:\n Navigating Nasty Rivers as OOP \n\nLJ\u2019s average strategic flop tendencies based on Suits\n4) 3-betting larger from OOP\n3-betting larger from out of position. Facing a 2bb UTG open in a 100bb 6-handed cash game, the solver uses a 7.5bb 3-bet on the BTN, a 10bb 3-bet from the SB, and a 12bb 3-bet from the BB. Larger 3-bets make it more likely you will take the pot down preflop, eliminating the risk of tricky turn and river decisions. They also reduce the SPR in the event you are called, making it easier to stack off with modest hands and/or get all the money in before the river. Even so, we once again see the solver\u2019s preference for suited hands when contesting a pot from out of position:\n Navigating Nasty Rivers as OOP \n\nSB response vs UTG (6-handed) min-raise in a 100bb cash game\nArriving on the River\nDoes it seem strange that this article about tricky river decisions has so far exclusively discussed preflop and flop decisions? That\u2019s no accident! You should think of your early street range construction as building the foundation upon which your later street decisions will rest. If you build a flimsy foundation, one that will be lopsided and wobbly on many rivers, then of course it\u2019s going to collapse.\nWhat follows is advice for how to make the best of a bad river situation, assuming you arrive there with the right kind of range. If your range is lopsided\u2014if you have too many weak-to-medium holdings and not enough nuts, for instance\u2014this isn\u2019t going to be enough to bail you out.\nEarly street ranges are the foundation for later street decisions.\nThis hand begins with UTG playing an SRP heads up against BTN in a 100bb full ring MTT. On a flop of K\u2660J\u26655\u2666, UTG c-bets 33% pot as the solver would with 72% of its range (this is an especially good flop for UTG). They follow through with an 83% pot bet on an 8\u2666 turn and then get a T\u2666 river, completing both the 4-out straight draws from the flop and the backdoor flush draw.\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily a nightmare, assuming you arrive at the river with a reasonable range and play it well. The solver expects UTG to have a significant equity advantage and to slightly over-realize (104%) that equity:\n Navigating Nasty Rivers as OOP \n\nUTG vs BTN river breakdown\nThat\u2019s mostly a holdover from the big equity and nuts advantage they enjoyed after the turn action. Other rivers are even more favorable, with the T\u2663 offering 113.7% EQR and the very blank 2\u2663 110.9% EQR. And parts of UTG\u2019s range will suffer, as they are no longer the monsters they once were. This includes not just one pair hands like AK and AA but even sets!\n Navigating Nasty Rivers as OOP \n\nEquity realization of UTG\u2019s river range on K\u2660J\u26655\u2666 8\u2666 T\u2666\nThose equity realization numbers are best-case scenarios. They rely upon precise balancing to avoid excessive vulnerability on any branch of the game tree. This includes the \u201cCheck\u201d and \u201cBet 10%\u201d lines, which are especially tricky to balance and so often correctly perceived as weak.\nBecause this is such a tricky spot, it will be harder than usual for us mere mortals to achieve the solver\u2019s theoretical EV. But we can get close by deriving heuristics from the solver\u2019s strategies.\nDon\u2019t Give Up Now\nIt\u2019s easy (and correct) to imagine all the ways this river card may have helped your opponent. Just keep in mind they will be imagining the same thing about you. Your range for betting flop and turn should consist mostly of strong made hands and strong draws, so on a river that completes all your obvious draws, it will be hard to find weak hands to bluff with. In the event that you do have one, you should go for it!\n Navigating Nasty Rivers as OOP \n\nUTG\u2019s river strategy displayed as a Manhattan graph\nThe solver purely bets its worst hands, indicating they are profitable rather than breakeven bluffs. The only weak hands mixing checks are those with a shred of showdown value or blockers to the opponent\u2019s folding range (usually both, since middle pair type hands are an important part of the folding range).\nSet Traps\nDid you notice, on the above Manhattan graph, there are also a lot of checks and small bets at the top end of Hero\u2019s range? Those are important! You\u2019re going to be checking and block betting a lot of genuinely vulnerable hands, creating an incentive for your opponent to attack with big bets and raises. This, in turn, incentivizes you to include some nutted hands in those ranges to profit from that aggression.\n Navigating Nasty Rivers as OOP \n\nUTG\u2019s river strategy with flushes\nThe best traps block hands that would call a large bet.\nThe solver distributes flushes across all its ranges (the biggest bet sizes are not used by any hand). But the distribution is not arbitrary. Some are better for betting, and some for trapping.\nThe best traps are hands that block the opponent\u2019s calling range, which is heavy on King-x and big diamonds. These hands are unlikely to get called when they bet big, so they check or bet small instead.\nDon\u2019t Bet Too Big\nUTG\u2019s big bet on the turn was designed to set up big, polar river bets. On a blank river, overbets are a significant part of their strategy. This is because BTN\u2019s range is largely capped after just calling the flop and turn, and a blank river does nothing to change that.\nThis is not a blank river, however. It uncaps BTN, promoting enough draws and medium-strength hands to monsters that UTG no longer possesses the kind of nuts advantage that would incentivize big, polar bets. So, the largest size they use is 86% pot, despite having nearly 3x pot remaining in the effective stacks.\n Navigating Nasty Rivers as OOP \n\nEquity distribution on the river: K\u2660J\u26655\u2666 8\u2666 T\u2666\nUTG\u2019s largest advantage is located in the middle of the equity distribution, so they focus their attack there via medium-sized bets, even when they have the nuts.\nChecking Is Not Giving Up\nYou\u2019re going to find yourself in a lot of awkward, uncomfortable spots when a \u201cscary\u201d river card lands. That\u2019s what makes it scary. Some of your hands will under-realize their equity, which is another way of saying you\u2019re going to sometimes fold the winner or pay off when behind. But take a breath; all is not lost.\nYour opponent is not necessarily always going to pounce on your checks and block bets with big bets or raises. They don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re checking to fold, checking to call, or even checking to raise. Sometimes, they will have a slightly weaker medium-strength hand of their own and be content to take a cheap showdown along with you. That\u2019s where most of the value of checking comes from.\nBecause you\u2019re checking some nutty hands hoping to raise for value, you can also check-raise some bluffs. These are refreshingly easy to find:\n Navigating Nasty Rivers as OOP \n\nWhen checking AK, you are not necessarily checking to bluff. Your hand has showdown value, and you will sometimes win a checked-down pot. Only when your opponent bets does your hand lose its value. Even then, if you have a diamond, your hand is a candidate for calling to beat bluffs or raising to push Villain off two pair and sets (their thinner value bets).\nA Block Bet Is Basically a Check\u2026 or Is It?\nChecking or betting 10% of the pot is virtually the same thing here. Both put very little money into the pot, and your opponent should respond similarly to either, by betting or raising roughly the same hands for the same size and calling most of the same hands they would have checked back. Everything mentioned above about which hands to check and how to respond to a bet applies to block betting as well.\nWhen you\u2019re in position, it\u2019s a different story because a bet re-opens the action and exposes you to a raise, while a check guarantees you a showdown. From out of position, your block betting range should in theory be slightly stronger than your checking range, but it\u2019s a tiny difference.\nUnless your opponent handles one worse than the other. We\u2019re getting into exploitative territory here, so proceed at your own risk. If you can predict your opponent\u2019s response in one of the following exploitable ways, you can adjust your ranges to increase your profit:\n            * Over-folding to small bets. This doesn\u2019t have to entail folding anything good. Some players are just much more willing to bet than to raise. If they don\u2019t bluff raise, they will end up folding too much because they won\u2019t have \u201canything good\u201d often enough. This means you should shift your weak hands into the small bet range to profit from these folds, and also that you should trap with your strong hands by checking rather than block betting.\n            * Under-folding to small bets. Even getting 11:1, it is occasionally correct for your opponent to fold. Some egos can\u2019t handle that though. These players take the small bet as a personal insult and call and raise too aggressively as a result. Exploit them by never bluffing with this line, moving more traps into your block bet range, and bluff catching more often when they raise.\n Using New Skills at the Poker Table \n\n            * Failing to raise for thin value. Your opponent does not need a flush to raise your block bet. Two pair is good enough, just as it would be good enough to value bet after you check. Against players who won\u2019t raise without the near-nuts, block betting is preferable to checking with all your medium hands. It enables you to squeeze a little more value when ahead while facing fewer tough decisions when raised (not necessarily because the decision is easier\u2014your opponent\u2019s raising range could still make you indifferent to calling\u2014but simply because they will raise less often).\nConclusion\nPlaying out of position is always tough, even if you\u2019re a solver. It\u2019s especially tough when the board texture changes dramatically, devaluing some of your hands and promoting others.\nThe first step is to take a breath and remind yourself this card may be scary for your opponent as well. Then it\u2019s time to reassess what your hand is worth. You need to play the hand you have now, not the hand you had on the previous street.\nPlay the hand you have now, not the hand you had on a previous street.\nIf your hand is now toward the bottom of your range, it may well be time to bluff. If it still has showdown value, you can start with a check, though you should remain open to the possibility of turning it into a bluff if your opponent bets.\nThere\u2019s only so much you can do to salvage the EV of your previously strong hands. They are going to face tough decisions sometimes, no matter what.\nWhat you can do is remember, when you have a monster hand, how easily you could have something more marginal and how worried you would be if you did. You can recall how you\u2019d need to check or block bet those hands, and how much you\u2019d hate it if you faced a big bet or raise after doing so. Then you can consider taking that same line as a trap with your monster.\nWhat Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\nJust how costly is it to play a Chip EV style when ICM is significant? We always knew it was a mistake, but we now have an answer thanks to this recent article from Tombos21. He started his search by mapping out the stages of a tournament. Via the data of single-raised and 3-bet pots, it\u2019s possible to empirically demonstrate the average $EV loss of sticking to a Chip EV strategy.\nIt turns out that doing this can cost you as much as 30% of your buy-in in EV. It\u2019s likely much more though, as only flop strategy was included in the experiment. Again, I implore you to read the article for more detail.\nA Flourish chart\nThis was across 225 flops for both single-raised pots and 3-bet pots. I thought it would be fun and instructive to piggyback on the work Tombos21 had already done by going into depth in a couple of specific hands and replicating the experiment. This means nodelocking a player to follow the Chip EV strategy in an ICM hand and then observing how they get exploited by their opponent.\nPreflop Ranges: Chip EV vs ICM\nThe first consideration is preflop. For a given spot, the ICM range will not be the same as the equivalent Chip EV range because ICM aims to maximize money ($EV) while Chip EV maximizes chips (cEV). This leaves us with a quandary regarding our experiment setup.\n            * Should we use the ICM range and the Chip EV range? And then compare them? This would give us a more realistic overview of how both spots would play, but it means there will be hands doing interesting things in one range that are not even in the other range.\n            * Or should we use the same range twice? Even though it will not be appropriate for one situation? This does mean we can get the best idea of the broad strategic adjustments that ICM presents.\nI say, let\u2019s do both!\nPreflop Range Comparisons\nFirst, let\u2019s see what happens when we simply use a Chip EV range when we should use an ICM range, but let the solver play as well as it can postflop afterward.\nThis is the 30bb Chip EV range for UTG:\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\nSymmetrical stacks: 30bb UTG open in Chip EV (\u2191) and ICM (bubble) (\u2193)\nAnd this is the 30bb ICM range for UTG near the bubble:\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\nAs you can see, it is slightly tighter (by 1.4%). The shape is also subtly different; we play fewer pocket pairs and medium suited connectors but more Ace-x hands for their blocker value.\nIn response to the open, this is what the BB does in Chip EV world:\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\nBB response vs UTG open in Chip EV(\u2191) and ICM (bubble) (\u2193)\nAnd this is what they do near the bubble:\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\nIn a strong ICM environment, there is much more folding by offsuit hands and less raising (despite the allowed raise size being smaller). The bluffs come from suited Ace and King-x hands due to their blocker value and the chance to make a flush. Compare this with a Chip EV setting, where bluffs are picked more from the trashy offsuit portion of the range. Overall, the bluffing range is more polar in ICM. Perhaps the biggest difference is in the way very strong hands like QQ are played: more passively when ICM is a factor, whereas we are raising regularly with TT+ when just playing for chips.\n\u2192 To summarize, UTG\u2019s range is almost identical both times, but the BB has relatively more drastic differences between both scenarios.\nPostflop Sneak Peek\nHow significant a mistake would it be for the BB to stick to a Chip EV range on the bubble?\nLet\u2019s look at a simple hand example to find out. The BB defends via call and the flop is 9\u26658\u26652\u2666.\nIn both instances, the BB checks 100% of the time.\nThis is what UTG does when both preflop ranges are the ICM ranges:\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\nUTG c-bet flop strategy vs preflop ICM BB\nThere is a mix of actions, and the bets lean towards the larger size, as this is a classic polarized range for UTG.\nNow, let\u2019s see what UTG does when checked to by the BB who\u2019s wrongly using a Chip EV range:\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\nUTG c-bet flop strategy vs preflop Chip EV BB\nIt has almost become a range-bet. The large sizings are still favored, but there is also a small-betting range. In this instance, UTG can attack the BB so much because their range is much weaker due to it containing more trash (that has been let through by the wider preflop defense). In ICM world, the BB flats with QQ\u201399 at full frequency, but these hands mostly raise preflop in Chip EV world. This makes it easy for UTG to attack the BB, because they are not worried about overpairs.\n            * When both players have ICM ranges \u2013 UTG makes 3.2bb on average at the start of the hand and the BB 1.95bb.\n            * When we assign the BB a Chip EV range \u2013 UTG makes 3.71bb on average and the BB 1.43bb.\nWe haven\u2019t even nodelocked yet; we have simply put the wrong range into the solver and allowed both players to play perfectly on the flop, but the BB still incurred a significant cost.\nThe losses from not accounting for ICM already start ticking up during the preflop phase.\nPostflop Strategy: Chip EV vs ICM\nNow, let\u2019s compare apples to apples and give both players the \u2018correct\u2019 (ICM-adjusted) ranges preflop but not the correct postflop strategy. What we need to do now is give both players the same type of range but run the sim twice, once in the Chip EV model and once in the ICM model. After that, we nodelock the ICM simulation so that one player follows the strategy from the Chip EV sim.\nWe find ourselves in the following situation: 30bb effective, the CO has opened, the BB has called, and the flop is 932r.\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\nI will study an ICM bubble scenario, so I\u2019ll use the same ranges each time. In this case, 30bb symmetric near the bubble.\n1. Chip EV Simulation\nTo kick things off, let\u2019s look at the Chip EV spot. In all the next examples, the BB checks 100% of the time. This is the CO\u2019s c-bet flop strategy for chips:\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\nCO c-bet flop strategy vs BB: Chip EV\nA mixed strategy with checking, medium-sized betting, and small betting each \u2153 of the time.\nThe primary bet size is 33% pot, and this is how the BB responds to it:\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\nBB response vs CO\u2019s 33% pot flop c-bet: Chip EV\n2. ICM (Near Bubble) Simulation\nUp next is the CO c-bet flop strategy on the bubble of a 200-runner tournament. Both stacks have 30bb, which is also the tournament average on the bubble:\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\nCO c-bet flop strategy vs BB: ICM (near bubble)\nIt\u2019s worth pausing just to look at the effect of ICM on the strategy. The two classic adjustments are:\n            * Bet sizings go down \u2013 A mixed strategy has become an almost exclusively 20% pot range-bet strategy.\n            * The c-bettor is more aggressive in terms of frequency \u2013 They bet 91% of the time instead of 65% of the time.\nWe can see why when we look at the BB response to the 33% bet. (We can no longer make a perfect comparison as 33% was the primary bet size in Chip EV and 20% is the primary bet size now, but 33% is still used some of the time):\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\nBB response vs CO\u2019s 33% pot flop c-bet: ICM (near bubble)\nThe BB has to play more cautiously on the bubble. They raise around 17% of the time here, compared to 24% of the time in Chip EV world. The CO bets small more often because they are less concerned about being raised. The underlying reason is that hands require more equity to put chips in the pot, resulting in less hands making the cut.\n3. Nodelock Chip EV Strategy in ICM Simulation\nLet\u2019s now look at what happens when we mimic a Chip EV strategy on the bubble using nodelocking. If you want to do this yourself, I have done it the \u2018easy\u2019 way by inputting the Chip EV frequencies for each action rather than adjusting every single hand for the perfect frequencies. As you can see, the solver came very close to mirroring the Chip EV strategy perfectly. The frequencies are probably what matters the most anyway in this experiment, given we almost range-bet in ICM world and we mix everything in Chip EV world.\n gto wizard what happens when playing chip ev and icm is significant image ex 35 \n\nNodelock CO in the ICM simulation to play Chip EV strategy\nNow, when we make that 33% pot bet, this is how the BB responds (we have not changed the BB strategy to Chip EV):\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\nBB response vs CO\u2019s (nodelocked: Chip EV) 33% pot flop c-bet: ICM (near bubble)\nThe BB folds more often, 40% of the time, compared to 37% of the time when they faced the correct ICM strategy. They do raise more often, however.\nThis is not where the biggest error is being made. Let\u2019s look at what happens when the CO goes for that 84% pot bet, which is never used in the correct ICM strategy. Let\u2019s first look at the Chip EV response from the BB to that bet:\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\nBB response vs CO\u2019s 84% pot c-bet: Chip EV\nAnd this is the response to that same bet but on the bubble:\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\nBB response vs CO\u2019s (nodelocked: Chip EV) 84% pot c-bet: ICM (near bubble)\nThe BB folds less often, ~45% of the time compared to ~56% in Chip EV world. They also raise less often, more than 13% of the time, compared to ~15% in Chip EV world.\nThis is the response to the check/raise in Chip EV world:\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\nCO response vs BB\u2019s 33% pot check/raise (vs CO\u2019s 84% pot c-bet): Chip EV\nAnd this is the response on the bubble:\n gto wizard what happens when playing chip ev and icm is significant image ex 32 \n\n gto wizard what happens when playing chip ev and icm is significant image ex 31 \n\nCO response vs BB\u2019s 33% pot check/raise: ICM (near bubble)\nThe CO folds more and raises less. They are forced to play their range more conservatively. Remember, this is the solver adjusting the best way it can after making an initial mistake. A real-life opponent is less likely to see the error of their ways.\nFor fun, let\u2019s drive it further and see what happens if the CO adopts the same Chip EV strategy when facing the check/raise by nodelocking the same frequencies. Let\u2019s look at how the BB acts on the previous node, facing the 84% pot c-bet:\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\nBB response vs CO\u2019s (nodelocked: Chip EV) 84% c-bet & response vs x/r: ICM (near bubble)\nThey fold a little more and raise much less. They raised 14% of the time in the last example but now only 10%. Another big difference is the shape of the range; it is very polarized now. All the best hands raise and a few trashy bluffs (that have some blocker and/or backdoor value). But in the previous example, there were similar value hands that called, and some of the middle-strength hands raised.\nThe BB has tournament survival to concern themselves with too, so they can no longer raise as wide if their opponent does not respect ICM. However, they do get to play all their best hands precisely how they want without having to look after the middle of their range too much.\n What Happens When Playing Chip EV and ICM Is Significant \n\nNote: In the last example, the missing 0.02bb went to the rest of the field.\nSummary\nWe talk about nits and calling stations when it comes to exploitative strategy, but this might actually be the most common leak in poker: Playing Chip EV when ICM is significant. People who blindly follow Chip EV strategy and ignore ICM are common (I know from experience, having written several books on ICM, the hardest part was convincing people they were necessary). This is especially true of preflop, where some players follow the same charts at every stage of the tournament without further thought.\nIn the cases we studied, this was the most significant discovery:\nThe bigger error was using a Chip EV preflop range in an ICM spot even though postflop play was optimal, rather than playing the Chip EV strategy postflop.\nThis makes sense if you consider the compounding effect of a preflop mistake, which carries over to most subsequent streets.\nDo note that we have only touched on the flop here, and as Tombos21 suggested in the article that inspired this one, the cost of this leak on the turn and river is likely even more severe!\nMastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\nThe new postflop ICM feature from GTO Wizard is a game changer. Previous incarnations of postflop ICM solvers have been challenging to use and are slow. When you factor in that GTO Wizard also allows bounty calculations and nodelocking with this feature, it might be one of the biggest strategic steps forward in poker technology for quite some time.\nAs somebody who has previously analyzed postflop ICM spots the \u2018old\u2019 way, here are some pitfalls to avoid when using this powerful new feature.\nNot Comparing ICM to Chip EV\nJust like how GTO is a baseline for you to understand exploits, Chip EV is a baseline to help you understand ICM. The first error you could make when studying postflop ICM is to not compare the outputs to the corresponding Chip EV situation. You develop a much more holistic understanding of ICM when you know what the strategy is deviating from.\nChip EV\nFor example, this is 30bb effective, BB vs UTG single-raised pot, and the flop is 976r, in Chip EV world. We are using dynamic bet sizing in GTO Wizard AI for all these examples. The first action is from the BB:\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\nBB first-in flop (Chip EV) strategy vs UTG on 976r: 30bb effective\nAfter their check, this is the UTG response:\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\nUTG c-bet flop (Chip EV) strategy vs BB on 976r: 30bb effective\nICM (Money Bubble)\nNow, let\u2019s look at the same spot, same stacks, with the only difference being that we are on the bubble with 151 remaining in a 1,000-runner MTT (with 150 paid). The BB\u2019s first action:\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\nBB first-in flop (ICM bubble) strategy vs UTG on 976r\nAs you can see, the BB has developed a donking strategy with 8% of its range. When they do check, this is what happens:\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\nUTG c-bet flop (ICM bubble) strategy vs BB on 976r\nUTG bets (~12%) less often in this example and the bet sizing has come down a little. They bet their sets proportionally much more often now and check back AA all the time.\nWhen UTG does bet, this is what the BB does in Chip EV world:\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\nBB (Chip EV) response vs UTG\u2019s 65% pot c-bet\nThis is what happens in the ICM example:\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\nBB (ICM bubble) response vs UTG\u2019s 65% pot c-bet\nThere is more folding in ICM world and no raising all-in, but in Chip EV world, the BB is happy to go all-in ~4% of the time.\nThe strategy is significantly different when ICM is a factor, and this is with equal stack sizes. It would be even more pronounced if the effective stacks were 30bb, but one of the players covered the other significantly.\nBy just studying the ICM sim and ignoring the Chip EV one, we only learn half the story.\nWe would know the \u2018correct\u2019 way to play this specific spot, but we would not learn about the many ways in which ICM more broadly changes our strategy. By comparing the two, we might make the following assumptions about postflop ICM:\n            * Bet sizings come down\n            * Covered players are tighter\n            * You can lead more in some situations\n            * All-in is often less appealing of an option\n            * Some hand classes play differently\nNote that these are all relative statements (e.g., tighter, lead more, \u2026). All of them are trends you will often see in postflop ICM, and the only way to discover them is by contrasting the ICM strategy with its Chip EV equivalent.\n Responding to BB Squeezes \n\nOne quick note regarding the preflop ranges when comparing Chip EV to ICM: an ICM range for a spot will not be the same as its Chip EV counterpart. Generally speaking, ICM ranges will be wider for chip leaders and tighter for mid and short stacks.\nThis leaves us with a dilemma when setting up the postflop simulation:\n            * Should we input the different but \u2018correct\u2019 ranges for each environment, and then compare them?\nThis would give us a more realistic overview of how both spots would play, but it also means there will be hands doing interesting things in one range that are not even in the other range. So, realistic but harder to compare.\n            * Or should we use the same range twice, even though it will not be appropriate for one situation?\nThis does mean we can get the best idea of the broad strategic postflop adjustments that ICM presents.\nI don\u2019t think there is a perfect answer (I did both in this article). The important thing is to be aware that neither approach is perfect and frame your takeaways in that context.\nAssuming All Pay Jumps Are the Same\nUntil very recently, a large cohort of players ignored ICM until they were on the literal money bubble, at which point they would fold almost everything. Once the bubble burst, they would resume ignoring ICM. Few players do this now, but there is still a danger of treating one type of ICM pressure the same as any other.\nThe bubble of a PKO is different from that of a regular MTT, which is different from that of a satellite. The final table bubble is different from the money bubble. A final table with six left differs from a final table with seven left. A tournament with 100 runners is different from a tournament with 1,000 runners, and so on. If you keep using a default payout structure in a cookie-cutter fashion, you are going to miss out on some valuable lessons.\nLet\u2019s look at an example to demonstrate. We will be using the same BB vs BTN single-raised spot every time. They both have 40bb. We\u2019ll keep the ranges the same even when the payout structure changes for ease of comparison. 151 players remain, 150 get paid, and the average stack is 40bb. The field totaled 1,000 runners.\nThe flop is T52r.\nThe BB checks 100% of the time, and this is the BTN response:\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\nBTN c-bet flop (ICM bubble of 1,000-runner MTT) strategy vs BB on T52r: 40bb effective\nNow, what if we look at the exact same spot, but this time there were only 200 runners in total? The money bubble now reaches maturity when 31 players remain. The average stack size is 40bb again. The BB checks 100% again and this is the BTN response:\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\nBTN c-bet flop (ICM bubble of 200-runner MTT) strategy vs BB on T52r\nAs you can see, there is less betting on the 200-runner bubble than the 1000-runner bubble. This is because on the 1000-runner bubble, the min-cash is much more important, and as such, we can exert more ICM pressure on the BB. We can\u2019t push our opponent around as much in the 200-runner tournament because they are closer to the top prizes and, therefore, a little more incentivized to play for the win.\nLet\u2019s add another twist to this same spot with 200 runners, of which 31 remain, averaging 40bb. The only change is the setting being a satellite with all prizes of equal value. The BB checks 100% of the time and this is \u2026 not what I expected. Below is BB\u2019s first-in flop strategy:\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\nBB first-in flop (ICM bubble 200-runner satellite) strategy vs UTG on T52r\nThe BB shoves 100% of the time rather than checks 100% of the time. Treating a satellite bubble like an MTT bubble is mistaking night for day. The bubble in satellites are all-or-nothing. In this example, a rational BTN who\u2019s aware of the payout implications would even fold a set of Tens here, because there is no upside in accumulating more chips when you have a seat virtually locked up.\nIf we nodelocked so that the BB checked 100% of the time, this is how the BTN responds:\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\nBTN c-bet flop (ICM bubble 200-runner satellite) strategy vs BB on T52r\nThey also shove range. Clearly, not all bubbles are the same.\nI could go on, but I think I have made my point. ICM is influenced by the stage of the tournament, field size, and the payout structure.\nWhile most MTT structures are roughly similar, minor changes can have an outsized impact on strategy.\nThe WSOP Main Event, for example, tends to be a little more top-heavy than other WSOP events as the operators try to make for a marketable first prize. This has often influenced the strategy, and using a generic Sunday Million payout structure for the Main Event could lead to a big error.\nWhile it\u2019s important to correctly assess these aspects that influence the formation of bubble factors, in the end, if the bubble factors are the same, the strategies will be too. In theory, if two players have the same bubble factors on the bubble of the Super High Roller Bowl or with 10 left before the money in a two-seat satellite to win a $50 ticket, the strategy should be identical.\nNot Being Accurate With the Stacks Outside of the Hand\nIn addition to the above factors, it\u2019s also important to correctly consider the other inactive stacks remaining in the tournament. Where possible, input every stack size manually.\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\nSetup ICM hand: tournament stage info (stack distribution = manual)\nMost of the time, you will use the Automatic Stack Distribution feature, where you input:\n               * The remaining players\n               * The average stack\n               * It also allows us to tinker with the stack distribution.\nThis greatly boosts your quality of life compared to inputting every stack. For the most part, it won\u2019t make a great deal of difference to the output as long as you get the averages right in large-field MTTs. However, as fields get smaller, the other stack sizes really matter.\nFinal (two) table(s) is perhaps the tournament stage that you want to be as accurate as possible with these inputs because an extreme outlier stack can have a sizeable impact on the strategy with fewer players and significant ICM pressure. A super short stack on another table during the FT-bubble, for example, where folding would guarantee you a ladder.\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\nPlease be aware, however, whenever you change the stacks of the two postflop players, it automatically changes the average stack size.\nI discovered this the hard way when I was running the same spot over and over but kept making the OOP player a bigger and bigger stack.\nYou can see for yourself, if I double the BB\u2019s stack above (from 120bb to 240bb) \u2026\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\n\u2026 the average stack goes from 30bb to 135bb, because you have introduced more chips to the tournament, rather than taking them from the stacks on the other table. This can have a significant impact on the strategy. So, if you are going to use the automatic stack distribution feature, input the average stack size every single time you run a hand.\nMake sure you also spread the stacks out in a \u2018realistic\u2019 manner rather than making them all equal (unless it is a hand at the start of a tournament or a shootout-type format).\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\nNote \u2013 All stacks remaining have the same size (= avg. stack of 135bb)\nWhen we don\u2019t vary the spread of stacks on a bubble of a J\u2666T\u26662\u2660 flop, this is the BB\u2019s first action from the examples above:\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\nBB first-in flop strategy when stack distribution = uniform\nBut when we vary the spread of stacks, even though the average is the same, this is the BB\u2019s first action:\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\nBB first-in flop strategy when stack distribution = non-uniform\nI\u2019ll not get into the weeds with this one, but as you can see, it is a significant change in strategy. ICM is always impacted by your relative position in the tournament. The more short stacks there are, the more likely it is that everyone else can move up the pay ranks. If there are a lot of big stacks, everyone else might need to make a move to stay in the game. That\u2019s an oversimplified way of looking at it, but it\u2019s just to make the point that the other stacks in the tournament really matter.\nNot Nodelocking\nFor most players, GTO Wizard\u2019s new postflop ICM feature set will be their gateway into getting exposure to strategies like the one laid out above. Some of the insights may shake up their view on poker so much that they won\u2019t even delve into the fact they can nodelock too. This might be the most exciting because the least explored area of poker: \u201cHow to play in tough ICM spots when your opponent is making clear mistakes?\u201d\nI would suggest that the biggest mistake you can make, in the long term, is not making the most of the opportunities this breakthrough creates because few people are.\nAgain, let\u2019s jump into an example to help drive the point home. I have often heard people say that: \u201cWhen a calling station is on the bubble of a tournament, you should play like a nit against them, to avoid leveling yourself and busting out.\u201c\nIs this true?\nLet\u2019s inspect an example of this scenario. This is a bubble spot where the BTN opened off a 32bb stack, the SB sitting on 28bb responded by 3-betting, and the BTN has called. The flop is A72r. This is the SB\u2019s first action:\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\nSB c-bet flop strategy vs GTO BTN on A72r: 3-bet pot, 28bb effective stacks\nIt\u2019s very tight, with only betting ~11% of the time. We are covered, out of position, and one place away from the money. When we do bet, this is how the BTN responds:\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\nBTN\u2019s equilibrium response vs SB\u2019s 66% pot c-bet\nThe BTN folds ~52% of the time and calls ~45% of the time.\nWhat if we made them a calling station, a BTN who never folds flop?\nThis is what the SB should do:\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\n Mastering Postflop ICM: Avoid These Common Mistakes \n\nSB c-bet flop strategy vs never-fold BTN on A72r\nDespite being covered, we bet more than half the time, which is five times more than in the GTO example. They even bet with hands like KK\u2013JJ, which would seem like a mistake against a calling station on an Ace-high flop.\nThis seems common sense, but it goes against the conventional nitty wisdom some players swear by in these spots.\nThis is just one super simple example, the fun part is exploring these spots further. If you caught the bug, I implore you to look at satellite bubble spots and play around with the calling ranges. You will see some utterly crazy things with just a slight deviation from GTO.\nConclusion\nICM is influenced by:\n               * Stack sizes\n               * Payout structure\n               * The number of entrants\n               * Stage of the tournament\nTo get the most out of GTO Wizard\u2019s postflop ICM engine, you need to understand the significance of these factors.\nThe main consideration with stack size is that it frames where everybody finds themselves in the tournament relative to the other runners. Having the biggest or shortest stack is significant in endgame tournament spots. Likewise, the presence of large or small stacks not involved in the current hand influences the action. Which player covers the other in a heads-up pot is perhaps the most significant consideration.\nWhat matters in regard to the payout structure essentially boils down to how top-heavy or flat it is. The flatter the payout structure, the tighter play tends to be because the pay jumps are more significant. Conversely, a top-heavy structure incentivizes to \u2018play for the win.\u2019\nField size is important because the larger the field, the further away any one player\u2019s prospects of winning it are. Distance from the big payouts on the final table heavily influences strategy.\nMost players understand that the stage of the tournament is significant when dealing with the stone bubble, but ICM pressure becomes significant in postflop pots when around half the field has been eliminated. It is an ever-pressing concern thereafter (until heads-up where there is no ICM).\nIn summary, I would suggest to consider these three elements in your studies:\n               * Think of all these ICM factors whenever analyzing a postflop hand.\n               * Compare to Chip EV as a baseline every time to understand the broader takeaways of ICM.\nShort Stack Stealing on the Bubble\n Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble \n\nOpen-raising on the bubble into players who cover you is scary. Savvy opponents will recognize how dangerous it is for you to play a big pot on the bubble and look for opportunities to pressure you both before and after the flop.\nYet, there are hands strong enough to warrant contesting a pot on the bubble against covering players. Doing so profitably requires walking a fine line between getting value, protecting equity, and protecting what remains of your stack. Above all, it requires an awareness of your own range and the ability to leverage the strength of your opening range to help you win the pot even when your current hand is not strong.\nThis article will examine an SRP near the bubble between a somewhat short-stacked BTN and a covering BB. We will look at how preflop incentives shape postflop play, which should follow radically different patterns depending on the characteristics of the flop. While the exact ranges and strategies discussed here will be specific to these parameters (stack sizes, positions, tournament field size), the general principles will apply to other scenarios where the preflop raiser has a much higher risk premium than a caller from the blinds.\nPreflop Considerations\nMaking sense of postflop play in this scenario requires understanding the preflop incentives that nudge the players to see the flop with very different ranges. Earlier in the tournament, BTN and BB ranges are somewhat similar in an SRP, with both players incentivized to play many quite modest hands. But in this bubble case, a short-stacked BTN in particular should have a much stronger range.\nConsider the predicament: it folds to you on the BTN, with just two players remaining to act behind. You would love to steal the blinds and antes, which would increase your stack by more than 10%. But risking elimination so close to the bubble is an expensive proposition; few hands will be strong enough to stand up to the pressure that can be generated by the covering stacks in the blinds.\n How ICM Impacts Restealing From The Blinds \n\nDoes that mean you should only open with hands that can stand up to that pressure?\nThat could be a good adjustment against over-aggressive blinds, but there are two fundamental problems with this overly conservative strategy:\n               * Precisely because opening on the bubble is so risky, your opponents should expect you to be strong when you do it, which reduces their incentive to pressure you.\n               * You will often end up playing postflop, usually against a BB caller. You\u2019d prefer to minimize your opponent\u2019s ability to predict which boards you will or will not be strong on (because that could result in pressure as well).\nIf your opening range is too wide, you\u2019ll be vulnerable to 3-bets and other sorts of pressure from covering players. But if it is too tight, you may miss out on profitable steals.\nJust as in any other situation in poker, your default should be a balanced range unless you have an intentionally crafted exploitative strategy based on reads on the players behind you. Of course, you\u2019ll need a much better hand than usual to continue to a 3-bet, so your value range will be smaller, and that will necessitate a tighter range of \u201clight\u201d opens as well. But you should be capable of opening both.\nA helpful way of conceptualizing this is that folding in a tournament always has EV greater than $0 because your stack gains value whenever other players are eliminated, even if they are not at your table. On the bubble, the BTN\u2019s value of folding is much greater than $0 because it will practically guarantee a min-cash. Raising can still be correct, but the EV of doing so must be greater than the EV of folding, and that\u2019s a high bar.\n Flop Heuristics: OOP C-Betting in MTTs \n\nThe ideal candidates for the bottom of your opening range block your opponents\u2019 3-betting ranges and retain good equity when called. That means even your raise/folds should be mostly big, ideally suited cards.\nIn the example we\u2019ll be considering, the BTN is opening off an 18bb stack into an SB with 41bb and a BB with 26bb. The average stack is 35bb, very close to the bubble of a 1000-runner tournament.\n Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble \n\nNone of these players want to lose a big pot, but it is far worse for BTN, who risks elimination and the loss of the minimum prize they could almost certainly secure by folding. As a result, BTN has a bubble factor of 1.98, while BB\u2019s bubble factor against BTN is 1.3 and SB\u2019s is just 1.1:\n Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble \n\nBubble factors: near bubble of 1,000-player MTT\nBTN opens 17% of hands and jams another 2%, totaling 19%. This is a far cry from the ~50% opening frequency we should expect earlier in the tournament. Their raising range is heavy on Ace-x and King-x, and less studied players who never shove will be heavier still, with quite a few more offsuit Ace-x combinations in their range:\n Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble \n\nBTN opening strategy: ICM (near bubble)\nDespite the strength of BTN\u2019s opening range and some ICM pressure of their own, BB calls a much wider and more diverse range, folding only small, disconnected, offsuit hands:\n Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble \n\nBB response vs BTN\u2019s min-open: ICM (near bubble)\nBB is getting great odds to call and, as the covering stack, can anticipate some advantages when playing postflop. BTN should be playing cautiously, resulting in BB getting more free cards and cheap showdowns when they want them. BB can also use BTN\u2019s somewhat predictable range and the threat of the bubble to get some efficient bluffs and equity denial.\nWith BTN tightening up dramatically and BB somewhat less so, relative to comparable spots earlier in the tournament, we should expect to see a significant equity advantage for BTN on most flops. However, their emphasis on Ace-x and King-x hands in their raising range also means that while flops with big cards will be especially good for them, they will be more vulnerable on low card flops, especially those where BB can flop straights. They must play defensively on these flops, as BB should attempt to use their nuts advantage to apply pressure on these disadvantageous (for BTN) flops.\nWe will examine BTN\u2019s strategy heads-up against a BB caller on four flops:\n               * A62tt \u2013 an Ace-high flop with low cards\n               * AQ2r \u2013 an Ace-high flop with a second Broadway card\n               * 853tt \u2013 a low, disconnected flop\n               * 854tt \u2013 a low, connected flop\nAce-Low-Low\nBTN enjoys an enormous range advantage on A\u26606\u26662\u2666, with 68.5% equity to BB\u2019s 31.5% and a nuts advantage to boot.\n Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble \n\nEquity distribution BB vs BTN on A62tt: ICM near bubble\nThis follows straightforwardly from the preflop ranges we have discussed already. BTN\u2019s range is heavy on Ace-x, while BB\u2019s is diluted by many hands that miss this flop. Even the non-Ace cards (6 and 2) do not connect well with BB\u2019s range because they mostly fold their small offsuit cards preflop.\nThus, BB will struggle to defend their equity to even a small bet, and BTN basically min-bets their entire range when checked to:\n Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble \n\nBTN c-bet flop strategy vs BB on A62tt: ICM near bubble\nBTN\u2019s response to a half-pot raise\u2014BB\u2019s most commonly used raise size\u2014is also simple. There are a few cases where they call with a backdoor draw or fold a small pair without one, but mostly, they call if they have a pair or a flush draw and fold if they don\u2019t.\nIf you must play a pot on the bubble against a covering stack, you want easy decisions, so this is about as good as it gets. BTN\u2019s turn-barreling strategy is designed to offer easy decisions as well, which is to say, on a neutral turn like the 8\u2665, it\u2019s a big, polar bet with a strong Ace or better for value and unpaired trash for the bluffs:\n Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble \n\nManhattan plot of BTN\u2019s turn (8\u2665) strategy (after flop c-bet 20% pot)\nThat means BTN is not barreling draws here, unless they also have top pair:\n Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble \n\nDraws section in the \u201cFilters\u201d subtab\nEven blocking big diamonds is undesirable because flush draws will make up much of BB\u2019s folding range on the turn:\n Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble \n\nBTN\u2019s suit-specific turn c-bet strategy for all combos of KTo\nIt\u2019s usually not so easy to push opponents off 9-out draws, but in this case, because of the general strength of BTN\u2019s range on this board and the fact that BB is also under some ICM pressure makes it feasible.\nIf you must play a pot on the bubble against a covering stack, you want easy decisions.\nAce-Broadway-Low\nAs good as the A62 flop was for BTN, A\u2660Q\u26652\u2666 is better still. BTN has more than 74% of the equity and captures 85% of the EV! Yet, they continuation bet considerably less often on this flop:\n Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble \n\nBTN c-bet flop strategy vs BB on AQ2r: ICM near bubble\nThis is because more than half of BB\u2019s range flops less than 20% equity!\n Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble \n\nEquity distribution BB vs BTN on AQ2r: ICM near bubble\nBTN almost always pairs up on this flop, and when they don\u2019t, they often have a gutshot and two live cards (in fact, they are somewhat often ahead even when they miss). The bottom of BB\u2019s range, hands like 75o, are drawing nearly dead against BTN\u2019s pairs.\nWhen BTN flops a medium-strength hand that they don\u2019t want to play a large pot with (e.g., QJ, A\u26635\u2663, or JJ), they have little incentive to bet. Some of these hands, like JJ, perform poorly against BB\u2019s calling range. Others, like A5, will be strong enough to bet later if BB keeps checking but aren\u2019t looking to play for stacks, so sacrifice little by checking. They don\u2019t care about pushing the bottom of BB\u2019s range off its equity, nor are they looking to grow a pot against the top of that range. Betting these hands would not lose money, but it would mostly result in taking down pots BTN would have won anyway by checking.\nBTN has a few traps at the very top end of their range, where they block much of what would call multiple bets. But they don\u2019t slow-play often, because the rest of their checking range is strong enough that BB won\u2019t be terribly tempted to bluff into it. BTN never checks their worst hands, however; when they check, it\u2019s with stuff like J\u2665T\u2665 and 66, which retains some equity it would have lost by betting, especially if raised.\n Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble \n\nManhattan plot of BTN\u2019s flop strategy\nThese hands, even the small pairs, won\u2019t check all the way to showdown unimproved. After BTN checks the flop, they will be the new bottom of the range and will eventually bluff if BB keeps checking.\nOnce again, we see a polar strategy that largely avoids tough decisions by checking the hands that don\u2019t want to get raised or play for large pots.\nLow Disconnected\n8\u26665\u26653\u2665 is one of those flops that is obviously bad for BTN\u2019s Broadway-heavy range. But it isn\u2019t as bad as you might expect\u2014BTN retains more than 55% of the equity and realizes about that much of the EV as well\u2014but it isn\u2019t nearly as good as the Ace-high boards we\u2019ve investigated so far.\nA lot of BTN\u2019s equity is locked up in unpaired hands, which will face tough decisions on many runouts and would prefer not to grow the pot. If BB was forced to check, BTN would c-bet only about 12% of the time. By comparison, facing a forced check at an earlier stage of the tournament, BTN c-bets 63% of the time on this flop.\nBB, not wanting to give BTN this comfortable option, has a lot of incentive not to check. At equilibrium, they donk-bet roughly half their range for 20% pot.\nBTN\u2019s response is simpler than you might think; they mostly call (folding only their most hopeless hands) and jam a narrow range heavy on strong but vulnerable pairs. Note that there are no flush draws in this jamming range!\n Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble \n\nBTN response vs BB\u2019s 20% pot donk-bet on 853tt: ICM near bubble\nEven on the bubble, you can peel pretty wide, getting 6:1 odds (before factoring in risk premium) in position. Remember that this calling range is quite strong, featuring sets, big pairs, and strong draws. It will not be trivial for BB to keep barreling turns, so BTN often gets to see two cards for this low price.\nFacing a check, BTN actually shoves some of the same hands and bets a narrow range with more pairs and some draws and backdoor draws.\n Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble \n\nBTN c-bet flop strategy vs BB on 853tt: ICM near bubble\nKeep in mind that this is an equilibrium strategy that factored in BB\u2019s incentive to donk-bet many of their strongest hands. If you believe your human opponent would not have a donking range, you can exploit that by betting less often.\nPlaying later streets on this dynamic board will require an awareness of your own range. Your range is heavy on Broadway cards, so on Broadway turns, you can bet more aggressively. If you face bets on those turns, you don\u2019t need to get too stubborn about defending because you\u2019ll have many naturally strong hands. On blank turns, it will be correct to continue with more of your best unpaired hands, especially if the bet is small.\nLow Connected\n8\u26665\u26654\u2665 is a truly bad flop for BTN. They actually still have a slight equity advantage, but BB captures nearly 58% of the EV. They flop enough sets, straights, and two pairs (of these, BTN has only 88) to support a robust bluffing range and deter BTN from raising, especially because they also flop more pairs than BTN. Their equilibrium strategy is to lead their entire range!\n Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble \n\nBB donk-bet flop strategy vs BTN on 854tt: ICM near bubble\nBTN\u2019s response is actually pretty similar to the 853tt flop, with few folds and even fewer shoves:\n Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble \n\nBTN response vs BB\u2019s 20% pot donk-bet on 854tt: ICM near bubble\nWhen you\u2019re fortunate enough to face a check, you should be grateful for the free turn and not bet terribly often. This is BTN\u2019s equilibrium c-betting strategy:\n Short Stack Stealing on the Bubble \n\nBTN c-bet flop strategy vs BB on 854tt: ICM near bubble\nBecause checking is not really a part of BB\u2019s equilibrium strategy, however, any human player checking to you in this spot is likely doing so exploitably. And the exploit against a player who never donk-bets here is to check back your entire range.\nConclusion\nNot all flops encourage such extreme strategies, but by studying the extremes, we can build intuition around how to approach most flops. The King-high flops will play more similarly to the Ace-high ones. The lower flops will play more similarly to 853 or 854, depending on how connected they are. And so on.\nAt the beginning of this article, I said that, when opening from the BTN, \u201cyou\u2019d prefer to minimize your opponent\u2019s ability to predict which boards you will or will not be strong on.\u201d Since then, it seems like we\u2019ve talked about nothing except how some cards are obviously good for BTN and some obviously bad. What gives?\nThe key word here is \u201cminimize.\u201d Your preflop incentives force you to be somewhat predictable. There\u2019s real value in blocking the blinds\u2019 strongest hands, which you capture by opening mostly hands with an Ace or King in them. The key is to recognize what your opponent can deduce about your range based on this and play around it.\nYou don\u2019t want to go broke on the bubble, but that doesn\u2019t mean you immediately wave the white flag when you miss the flop. Your opponent, getting a great price and incentivized to bully you, will often miss the flop themselves, and you can leverage the stronger hands in your range to protect the weaker ones.\nOn Favorable Boards\nOn boards that strongly favor you, that means betting a polarized range, coupling your strong hands with your weak hands while checking medium-strength hands for delayed value or a cheap showdown. This is why 66 bluffs on AQX, even though it may have some showdown value. You have so few weak hands on this board that it is more profitable to bluff than to showdown a weak pair.\nOn Not-So-Favorable Boards\nOn boards that aren\u2019t supportive of your range, it means more calling and checking, even with your strongest hands, so your range is uncapped and dangerous to bet into. This minimizes (but doesn\u2019t eliminate) their ability to use bubble pressure and an unfavorable board against you.\nAbove all, the main takeaway of this article is the following:\nContesting pots against covering stacks on the bubble, requires accepting that you\u2019ll have to face some uncomfortable spots, make some uncomfortable tradeoffs, and generally under-realize your equity.\nYou must place a high premium on the last of your chips, and that will sometimes mean foregoing a protection-bet or even folding a hand that could easily be best.\nWhen you raise preflop, you really want the blinds to fold. When they don\u2019t, you\u2019ve got to make the best out of a bad situation. Sometimes the flop bails you out, but you should not expect to win as many pots or get as much value as you would at earlier stages of the tournament. Survival must take precedence!\nSlow-Playing\n Slow-Playing \n\nSlow-playing, like running a big bluff or making a heroic call, feels great when it works. It feels like you are winning by wits alone, playing your opponent like a fiddle as you cajole them into throwing ever more money into a pot they have no chance of winning.\nThe danger of this good feeling is that it may seduce you into slow-playing when it is not wise to do so, costing you many chips, if not the entire pot. Ultimately, you want to play big pots with your big hands, so it\u2019s best to find ways to create deception while still putting chips into the pot.\nIn this article, we will consider the incentives around slow-playing:\n               * What are the risks?\n               * What are the rewards?\n               * And when is it just fancy play syndrome?\nWhat Is Slow-playing?\nYou probably have some idea already, but for the sake of clarity, when I talk about slow-playing, I am talking about:\nDeliberately taking a passive line\u2014checking and calling\u2014with a hand strong enough to bet or raise for value.\nThe purpose of slow-playing is to deceive your opponent into thinking your hand is weaker than it actually is. To keep things simple, I will generally talk about slow-playing the flop, but similar considerations will apply to slow-playing before the flop or on the turn (or on other streets, in other games\u2014the material in this article is not terribly specific to Hold \u2018em).\nIncentives and Deception\nDeception is not an end in itself.\nYour ultimate goal when you hold a strong hand is for the pot to grow. Deception is valuable only insofar as it causes your opponent to put more money into the pot than they would have had you played your hand more aggressively.\n Flop Heuristics: OOP C-Betting in MTTs \n\nFor an extreme example, suppose you checked the nuts last to act on the river. That would certainly be deceptive, but it would not accomplish your goal of playing for big pots with big hands. This example may sound ridiculous, but in fact, people make ridiculous, counterproductive slow-playing decisions all the time because they fixate on deceiving their opponent rather than on growing the pot.\n Is Limping Pimping? \n\nDeception in poker is not necessarily about playing a hand contrary to its incentives. Often, you can be just as deceptive by playing your hand in a way that is perfectly aligned with its incentives but which could also credibly represent a different sort of hand with different incentives.\nAn Example\nSuppose you open the BTN in a 100bb cash game and the BB calls. You bet 125% pot on a K\u26609\u26655\u2666 flop and 125% pot again on a 2\u2663 turn.\nIs this a deceptive way to play a set of fives? Why or why not?\nFrom one perspective, it sure looks like you have a strong holding. You\u2019re shoveling money into the pot, with the threat of an all-in bet looming on the river. That\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d like to do with a very strong hand, and your opponent has good reason to fold for fear that you may have one.\nBut they also have good reason not to fold because, from another perspective, this is also exactly what you\u2019d like to do with some of your weakest holdings. Precisely because this is how you\u2019d like to play a strong hand, it\u2019s a good, deceptive way to play a weak hand. And vice versa. Playing strong and weak hands in this way gives both the opportunity to accomplish their objectives and puts your opponent in a genuinely tough spot.\nIn other words, it creates deception without compromising the incentives of each hand in the range:\n               * To grow the pot, in the case of a strong hand\n               * And to steal the pot, in the case of a weak hand\nAs it happens, the solver takes this line with both strong hands (such as sets) and weak hands (such as gutshots).\nWhat Does Slow-playing Represent?\nIn my experience as a coach, people tend to be very aware of \u201ctelling a story\u201d when they are bluffing. That is, they think about what they are representing and why it is plausible they could have that strong hand instead of the weak one they currently hold. But storytelling is just as important when you have a strong hand! In either case, the aim is to deceive your opponent by credibly representing a hand other than the one you currently have.\nWhen you check the flop, you may be telling the story that you are weak. But as soon as you put chips into the pot after checking, the jig is up. It no longer looks like you have a weak hand because weak hands usually fold after checking.\n Slow-Playing \n\nChecking and calling looks like either a medium-strength hand or a trap. That\u2019s not necessarily a problem, as representing a middling hand could entice your opponent to run a big bluff, but you should be aware of what you\u2019re representing so your play (storyline) remains coherent on later streets. If, after checking and calling, you come out with a massive bet on the river, that\u2019s not consistent with a medium-strength hand, nor is it the best way to win money from your opponent\u2019s bluffs, which is what you were presumably trying to induce by checking and calling in the first place.\nRisk 1: Giving Free Cards\nThe obvious risk of slow-playing, the one people are most aware of, is the risk of a free card costing you the pot. The less obvious risk is failing to grow the pot, which, as we will see, can cost you quite a lot of potential winnings even when it doesn\u2019t cost you the pot itself.\nMost humans tend toward loss aversion, an excessive concern for holding on to what they already have, even if it means missing opportunities to gain more than they would put at risk. It is understandable, then, that the average poker player would worry more about the risk of losing a pot they are currently winning than the risk of missing out on future winnings. Winning a big pot feels good, and your brain may deliver roughly the same dopamine hit for whether you win $500 or $700, whereas it may punish you excessively if your choice to slow-play costs you a pot your brain was already counting as its own.\n Cold Four-Betting \n\nThis is not to say that the risk of giving free cards is negligible, only that it tends to get too much attention in discussions around slow-playing. In particular, people tend to fixate on the wrong ways in which a free card could hurt them.\nA free card costs you the pot only if the hand that improved to beat you would have folded to a bet.\nBig, obvious, strong draws like flush draws and open-ended straight draws don\u2019t generally fold to bets, so while slow-playing may cost you the opportunity to put money in as a small favorite against those draws, it doesn\u2019t cost you as big of a pot when they draw out.\nThe scenarios where a free card really costs you dearly are when a hand that would have folded hits an unexpected miracle. If you check 55 on that K\u26609\u26655\u2666 and your opponent holding 66 turns a bigger set, you aren\u2019t costing yourself just the current pot but additional bets on the turn and river as well. It\u2019s not a likely scenario, but it\u2019s expensive when it happens.\n What is leverage in poker? \n\nRisk 2: Failing To Grow the Pot\nThe other risk of slow-playing is failing to grow the pot, which can result in winning much less when your opponent has a hand that would have put more money into the pot. Suppose you flop a royal flush against a very special opponent. This opponent will sometimes fold to flop bets, but they never fold to pot-sized bets on the turn and river. With $100 in the pot, you have a choice between two betting lines:\n               * You can bet 30% pot on the flop, 100% pot on the turn, and 100% pot on the river. Or,\n               * You can check the flop, bet 100% pot on the turn, and 100% pot on the river.\nHow often does your opponent need to fold the flop in option 1 to make it worse than option 2?\nIt\u2019s easy to calculate what option (2) is worth. Your opponent never folds, so you win a $100 bet on the turn, a $300 bet on the river, and the starting pot of $100, for a total of $500.\nWhen your opponent calls your $30 flop bet in option (1), you then bet $160 on the turn and $480 on the river, plus the starting pot, for a total of $770. Missing out on one small bet might seem like a small price to pay to get two big bets guaranteed on the turn and river, but because that small bet sets you up to make even larger bets on the later streets, you lost out on not just the $30 bet but a total of $270 over the course of the hand. Your opponent would need to fold the flop more than 40% of the time to the 30% pot flop bet to make option 1 less desirable!\nBut There Are Also Rewards\nReal poker is much more complicated, of course, but this simple example demonstrates one common effect of slow-playing:\nChecking the flop with a strong hand often makes it more likely you will get two bets, but less likely you will get three.\nThere are three primary means by which checking might induce your opponent to put in bets on later streets with hands that would not have paid you off otherwise :\n               * They had a weak hand on the flop and would\u2019ve folded, but the turn improves them to a second-best hand with which they are willing to pay off bets.\n               * Checking induces them to bluff with a weak hand that would have folded to a flop bet.\n               * Because you are generally incentivized to bet your strongest hands, they correctly lower their standards for putting money into the pot on future streets after seeing you check the flop.\nTiming Your Slow Plays\nIn light of the above risks and rewards, we can reach some conclusions about when slow-playing may be desirable. Recall the two major risks of slow-playing: getting outdrawn and failing to grow the pot. When neither of these represents a grave concern, slow-playing becomes more desirable.\nOn that K95r flop we\u2019ve been talking about, very few hands show a strong preference for betting over checking. The few that do include 55 and 99, but not KK. Why do you think that is?\n Slow-Playing \n\nEV comparison: check vs bet 33% pot\n Slow-Playing \n\n Slow-Playing \n\n Slow-Playing \n\nThe hands most likely to call you down on three streets have a King in them. So, the cost\u2014in the form of missed out on benefits\u2014of slow-playing KK is less than the cost of slow-playing lower sets because, when you so heavily block the BB\u2019s King-x hands, you are unlikely to get three bets paid off anyway. This is also why a set of Nines has higher EV than a set of Kings.\nAnother argument for slow-playing is when your hand simply is not strong enough to value-bet three times. In that case, checking doesn\u2019t cost you a bet because you weren\u2019t going to bet three times anyway.\nChecking as a slow play doesn\u2019t cost you a bet when that extra bet couldn\u2019t be profitably made.\nBTN often slow-plays their weaker Kings on this flop because they are tough to draw out on\u2014only one larger card could fall\u2014and won\u2019t bet three times unless they improve:\n Slow-Playing \n\nYou may not think of this as slow-playing, but that\u2019s essentially what it is, and there\u2019s an important point here:\nThe best hands for slow-playing are often not your very strongest hands, with which you\u2019d like to be growing the pot, but rather hands that are tough to draw out on but also not so strong they want to grow an enormous pot.\nThis is especially true when it comes to inducing bluffs, which is one of the three rewards of slow-playing we identified earlier.\nTop pair with a bad kicker beats bluffs just as surely as bottom set does, and it gives up a lot less when it checks to induce.\nIf you have ever seen young children play soccer, you will understand this concept intuitively. Before they understand the concept of (or have the necessary discipline for) playing position, children just swarm the ball, everyone trying to kick it all at once. There is nobody to pass to and nobody playing defense because they are all in a pack around the ball.\nHands in your range are like players on a soccer team: some fit certain roles/positions better than others, and your team will perform best when everyone sticks to their role/plays their position. Very strong hands excel at betting for value, so that is generally the position they should play. Medium-strength hands are better assigned to the bluff-catching position, especially when they are tough to draw out on.\n Slow-Playing \n\nIf you assign all your players to catch bluffs, then you\u2019ve got no one playing offense, a strategy that will perform about as well as those five-year-olds swarming the ball. They\u2019re cute, but it doesn\u2019t take Real Madrid to beat them. Even a team of slightly older children, executing slightly better on the game\u2019s fundamentals (roles), will pick them apart.\nShallow Stacks\nThere is another case where checking is unlikely to cost you a bet with your strongest hands: when the stacks are so shallow that you don\u2019t need three bets to get all-in. A 20bb sim for the same K95r flop shows a high frequency of slow-playing KK and 99:\n Slow-Playing \n\n(Even at 40bb, the lower sets sometimes slow-play.)\nNote that other strong hands such as AA, AK, KQ, and KJ purely bet. Of course, they don\u2019t require three streets to get stacks in any more than 99 does, but they are more vulnerable to free cards. With the pot being larger relative to the stacks, the reward for slow-playing is reduced, making the risk of getting drawn out on a greater concern for more vulnerable hands.\nAnother Way To Slow-Play\nAlthough KK and 99 do not really check in the 100bb equilibrium, they do often bet small. This is true despite the fact that BTN often uses larger bet sizes, including with these hands.\nWhy does a solver expect betting 33% pot with Kings to make just as much as betting 125%?\n Slow-Playing \n\nThis is, in essence, another form of slow-playing.\nA hand can be played slower not only by checking instead of betting (or calling instead of raising), but also by betting small instead of betting large.\nA small bet, at equilibrium, performs just as well as a large bet because it can induce bluffs (raises, in this case) and light calls, including from hands that would have folded to a larger bet but could improve to something still worse on the turn.\nA small bet is at least as consistent with how BTN would play some weak hands as checking is, and it has the added benefit of growing the pot. We have already seen how heavily even a small flop bet can increase your winnings on later streets compared to a check. KK is a good candidate for this play, just as it is for checking, because it blocks so many of the hands that would call a larger bet.\nIf BB calls this small bet, BTN can start growing the pot more dramatically with an overbet on the turn or continue \u201cslow-playing\u201d with another smallish bet. KK is once again a better candidate than 99 for the slow-playing option because of its blockers.\nConclusion\nUnderstanding the risks and rewards of slow-playing can help you better decide, in real-life game situations, which of these options is suitable with a given hand. As we saw in these examples, the equilibrium EVs often run quite close between checking, betting small, or betting large. But that does not mean they will actually be close against a human opponent!\nWill this player check-raise as aggressively as a solver would against a small c-bet? Will they fire big bluffs, possibly even overbets, if you check the flop? Will big bets make them suspicious, such that they call down light?\nSetting aside these human factors, there are structural considerations as well. Is a free card more likely to improve your opponent\u2019s weakest holdings to second-best hands or to something stronger than your monster? How large is the pot? How much remains in the stacks? Do you block the hands most likely to play a big pot with you?\nThat\u2019s a lot to consider, but the better you can manage that, the better your slow-playing decisions will be. But a good rule of thumb for slow-playing is: when in doubt, don\u2019t. You want to play big pots with big hands, and the most straightforward way to do that is simply to bet or raise at every opportunity.\nMDF vs ICM: Rethinking Bluffing & Defense Strategies in MTTs\n MDF in ICM \n\nMinimum Defense Frequency (MDF) is, strictly speaking, the calling (and/or raising) frequency that makes your opponent\u2019s 0% equity hands indifferent between bluffing and giving up. It\u2019s a frequently misapplied concept, because even in Chip EV scenarios, the hands you\u2019re aiming to make indifferent to bluffing not always have 0% equity. And, there are many spots where your opponent is supposed to get profitable bluffs.\nOnce we throw ICM into the mix, MDF goes out the window.\nThere are still spots in ICM where you want to make your opponent indifferent to bluffing, but equity is not the best measure of a hand\u2019s value. A central tenet of tournament poker is that chips lost are worth more than chips won, and that complicates the math behind bluffing, bluff-catching, and indifference.\n MDF in ICM \n\nICM in the Clairvoyance Game\nIn the Clairvoyance game, a player holding either the nuts or the nut low when last to act on the river with a pot-sized bet remaining in the stacks maximizes their (Chip) EV, at equilibrium, by always shoving the nuts while bluffing with half as many nut low combos. Because a pot-sized bet offers 2:1 odds on a call, this player makes their opponent indifferent to bluff-catching with a value:bluff ratio of 2:1.\nSimilarly, the player holding the bluff-catcher maximizes their (Chip) EV, at equilibrium, by calling half the time. Because a bluff would risk one pot to win one pot, a call:fold ratio of 1:1 makes the bettor indifferent to bluffing.\nTo simulate this game in a solver, we can:\n               * Set the ranges of BTN = {AA, QQ} and BB = {KK}\n               * On a board of 222 33\n(We don\u2019t even need to nodelock BB as a forced check, because they\u2019d have no incentive to bet anyway.)\nHere\u2019s a custom sim that recreates the Clairvoyance game, in Chip EV.\nEnter ICM\nIn some alternate universe, we play this hand near the bubble of a 1000-player MTT, with both players having an average stack. Here\u2019s the new betting strategy:\n MDF in ICM \n\nThe bluffing candidates fire ~94% of the time!\n MDF in ICM \n\nThis is a bit counter-intuitive because bluffing is much riskier on the bubble. The 10bb BTN stands to win if the bluff succeeds are not worth nearly as much as their last 10bb, which is what they will lose if the bluff is called. Why do they bluff so much more often then?\nRemember, the goal of bluffing (at the right frequency) is to make your opponent indifferent to bluff-catching. So, when you think about bluffing, you have to think about it in relation to bluff-catching. This is the key to understanding the above shift in strategy toward more bluffing. It makes no sense to bluff more given that it\u2019s more risky on the bubble. The thing is that bluff-catching is also much riskier on the bubble.\nIn fact, between the two, bluff-catching is even more risky here, because the majority of the time it results in elimination from the tournament. Even in this scenario, BTN is value-betting slightly more often than they are bluffing, which means BB will lose more often than they win when they call.\nOf course, with the pot-sized bet of 10bb already in the pot, BB wins twice as many chips when they catch bluffs as they lose when they run into value-bets. That\u2019s what motivates BTN to value-bet twice as often as they bluff in the Chip EV version of the game. With ICM in the mix, winning 20bb is nowhere near twice as good as losing your last 10bb is bad, so BTN must bluff more often to make calling at all appealing to the BB.\nUnlike BB\u2019s bluff-catches, which frequently (52% of the time) lose, BTN\u2019s bluffs get through more often (65% of the time). BB actually calls less often in this ICM scenario than in Chip EV, even though BTN is much more likely to be bluffing:\n MDF in ICM \n\nThis is because the goal of bluff-catching (at the right frequency) is to make the opponent indifferent to bluffing. Bluffing is very risky for the aggressor, so they must expect to get the bluff through fairly often\u2014more often than in a Chip EV scenario\u2014to risk attempting it.\nBet Sizing\nUnlike in Chip EV, ICM spots are not zero-sum between the players involved. A big confrontation is bad for both of them, because someone is going to lose something (the last 10bb of their stack) more valuable than what the other wins (another 10bb added to an already above-average stack).\nIf the loser loses more than the winner wins, what happens to the rest of that value?\nIt\u2019s distributed to the other players in the tournament, especially the short stacks who are sweating the bubble. There is some raw intuition around this even amongst unstudied players. A player losing the last of their chips on the bubble of a major tournament is often met with cheers, because it means everyone else has just secured a min-cash.\nThis is why we see the counterintuitive equilibrium of BB calling less often on the bubble even though BTN bluffs more often. In the game of ICM chicken, a big collision is bad for both players, especially when the last of their chips are involved. The aggressor bluffs more often because they expect their opponent to fold more often. Bluffing often results in them winning a big pot without that disastrous confrontation.\nThe defender, however, folds more often even when they know the aggressor is bluffing more often. Once the bet is out there, the only way to avoid a collision is to fold. The collision would be so severe that they are incentivized to avoid it even though they would often win a large (but still not worth it) pot by calling.\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s see what happens when we give the aggressor a choice of bet sizes:\n MDF in ICM \n\nIn a Chip EV context, the player with the polarized range would prefer to bet as large as possible, even if that meant shoving for one million times the pot. As long as they didn\u2019t run out of hands to bluff with\u2014which they couldn\u2019t in this scenario, because their bluffing frequency should never exceed 50% no matter how large they bet\u2014a bigger bet just means more unexploitable bluffing. With a sufficiently large bet size, they essentially capture the entire pot.\nWhen the polarized aggressor\u2019s risk premium is high, they perform best by holding on to the last of their chips.\nWinning an extra big blind with their value-bets isn\u2019t nearly as good as losing the last of their chips on a bluff is bad, so they take a slightly more conservative approach in an ICM context, leaving themselves room to hopefully fold into the money even if their bluff fails. Or, if value-betting, they represent that they are hedging against a failed bluff by doing the same.\nNote that they are still quite aggressive with the sizing, preferring to bet 80\u201390% of the remaining stack. Because the last of their chips are the most valuable, those are the only ones they really care about holding onto. The rest they\u2019d rather invest in the bet, as a larger bet facilitates more bluffs and bigger wins when value-bets are called.\nTo be clear, this is a different phenomenon from other not-quite-all-in bets, which you may see at any stage of the tournament. While there is always some ICM effect in a tournament, the main reason to leave a few chips behind earlier in the tournament is to retain the ability, in the event that you lose the pot, to invest those chips on the next hand getting amazing odds thanks to the blinds and antes. That\u2019s not the effect we\u2019re seeing here, as this sim does not incorporate any future game considerations.\nDownward Drift and Thin Value Bets\nWe\u2019re going to look at one final toy game that illustrates another important principle of ICM, which Dara O\u2019Kearney and Barry Carter call \u201cdownward drift.\u201d This game is similar to the Clairvoyance game, with two important differences:\n               * BTN has a range consisting of all pairs 44\u2013AA.  {44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, TT, JJ, QQ, KK, AA}\nBB has a range consisting of all pairs 77\u2013QQ.                         {77, 88, 99, TT, JJ, QQ}\nSo, BTN still has the more polar range, but there is now some overlap in the middle.\n               * BB is not allowed to raise. They are forced to check and then, regardless of the bet size they face, may only call or fold.\nHere is BTN\u2019s Chip EV strategy for this game when they are permitted a variety of bet sizes:\n MDF in ICM \n\nBTN river strategy: Chip EV\n MDF in ICM \n\nWith QQ+, they shove. These hands are all unbeatable, though QQ will sometimes chop, as it is also in the defender\u2019s range.\nThe 50% bet is for JJ. Though Jacks could profitably shove, the smaller bet size incentivizes BB to call with a wider range against which Jacks are a bigger favorite. Stronger hands never mix with this smaller bet size because the defender is not allowed to raise.\n77\u2013TT have too much equity to bluff but are not strong enough to value-bet (not for the bet sizes allowed in this sim, anyway).\nBluffs come from any combination of 44\u201366. These hands are all equally worthless and have no interaction with the defender\u2019s range, so while the bluffing frequency is important, it doesn\u2019t matter which combos are used for which bet size.\nInject ICM\nNow, here\u2019s the same game played on the bubble of a 1000-player tournament:\n MDF in ICM \n\nBTN river strategy: ICM (on the bubble)\n MDF in ICM \n\nEven the nuts play better as a 90% pot-sized bet than a shove (100% pot), just as we saw in the ICM Clairvoyance game.\nUnlike in the Chip EV sim, QQ prefers a smaller bet of 70% pot. The defender\u2019s reduced incentive to catch bluffs means that Queens chops more often against the hands that call a shove. 70% pot still gets big value while incentivizing more calls from worse.\nJJ also downsizes, betting 30% rather than 50% pot for the same reason.\nBluffs still slot equally well into any of the bet sizes. The overall bluffing frequency is higher because, just as we saw in the original clairvoyance game, this is necessary to make BB indifferent to bluff-catching on the bubble.\nBluff-catching gets increasingly undesirable as the bet size gets larger.\nThis is why the difference between BTN\u2019s bluffing frequency on the bubble and in Chip EV grows disproportionately with bet size as well.\nConclusion\nICM changes incentives around bluffing and bluff-catching, which changes optimal bluffing and bluff-catching frequencies. Intuition derived from MDF and Chip EV simulations will be an unreliable guide, when risk premiums are high! Instead, adjust by considering the following heuristics:\n                  * In tournaments, losing chips is worse than winning chips is good. The upside is smaller than the downside. This creates a risk premium.\n                  * Risk premium worsens the (ICM-adjusted) pot odds, disincentivizing calls. Put simply, bluff-catching is less attractive. As the aggressor, you should theoretically bluff more often or use smaller bet sizes to make your opponent indifferent between calling and folding.\n                  * Risk premium, however, also lowers the reward of bluffing. This means you should fold more often to keep your opponents indifferent to bluffing, especially when the bluff risks the last of their chips.\n                  * Tournaments incentivize everyone to be risk-averse. However, bluff-catching is inherently riskier than bluffing. That\u2019s because when you bluff-catch you are guaranteed to collide, whereas bluffing only sometimes results in a collision.\n                  * The last of your chips is the most valuable. When you are very close to the bubble or another pay jump, holding on to just a single big blind could enable you to secure a (bigger) prize. When betting the river, consider betting slightly less than all-in. You\u2019ll win less with your value-bets, but you\u2019ll avoid losing the last of your chips on a bluff (or if your value-bet gets called by better), and that\u2019s more important.", "metadata": {"source": "forrag"}}

The \nkey mindset is that you are comfortable losing the amount of money you \nplay with, recognizing that often that is the price of learning and \nimproving. \n\nRule #2 \u2013 Watch your Number of Buyins \n\nNever play a cash game with fewer than 25 buyins, or a tournament \nwith fewer than 50. \n\nWe would advocate that playing cash games with at least 40 buyins and \n100 for tournaments would be closer to optimal bankroll management. If, \nfor whatever reason, you must \u201cgo big,\u201d then please never exceed these \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nlimits. Under these scenarios, you will gamble effectively without feeling \nthe risk of losing your buyin. If you gamble with more money than your \npoker bankroll can stand to lose, then you\u2019ve already lost the game. \n\nRule #3 \u2013 Make Friends \n\nMake friends in poker as they can be your most trusted investors. \n\nIn an ideal world, you could always pick your buyin based on your current \nbankroll. The unfortunate reality is that stakes often move up by 2 or 2.5 \ntimes the previous stake. The result is often you will find it difficult to \nmove up in stakes without a significant amount of winnings at a prior \nstake. \n\nBy finding other poker players who view you as a profitable investment, \nyou can choose to sell them pieces of your action at higher stakes, \nallowing you to move up more quickly with less risk. Let\u2019s say, for \ninstance, you are a $1/$2 player looking to move up to $2/$5. This is an \nincrease of 150%! \n\nIt would be better if you could move up to $1.5/$3 or $2/$4 before taking \nall of your own action at $2/$5. In this scenario, if you have a friend who \nthinks you are a profitable investment in the $2/$5 game, you can sell \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nthem 40% of your action, effectively making the stakes $1.5/$3 and \nallowing you to play a bigger game with less risk. \n\nHaving this versatility is great in poker. Don't pass up opportunities to \nmake friends in the game who can help you distribute your risk. \n\nOne Final Thought: One thing you could choose to do when moving up is \nto play a bit tighter. This is especially effective in games that are very \nloose and a big part of your edge comes from players paying off value \nbets. If you play live and your game is tougher and your opponents know \nyou are shot taking and will be playing a more tight style you may want to \nchoose to sell action and play your normal game instead. \n\nRule #4 \u2013 Know When it's Time to Move \nDown \n\nAs poker players, we often have big egos. We are here to win, and a lot \nof poker players are known for their antics on and off the table. For this \nreason, a lot of players have a difficult time facing the music. When \nthings go badly, which at some point they will, you need to be able to \nhang up the gloves and live to fight another day. \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nThere is nothing wrong with having to move down in stakes because of \nlosses or because you do not think your play is up to par. Be confident, \nbut also be humble and know when it's time to move down. The most \nimportant part about bankroll management is to live to fight another day. \n\nPoker Lab Home \n\nUPSWING \n\nPOKER \nMembers \n\n\u2190 Previous Lesson \n\nNext Lesson \u2192 \n\nUPSWING POKER \n\u00a9 Copyright 2023 \nSitemap \nResponsible Gambling \nTerms of Service \nContact \n\nMerch \nFAQ \nContact \nVincent Guarnieri \nTRAINING \nARTICLES \n\n  \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nQUIZZES \nREVIEWS \nOUR PROS \nFREERESOURCES \nHome > Dashboard > The Poker Lab No Limit Simplified > Game Selection by Doug \nPolk & Ryan Fee \n\n Back \n\nGame Selection \n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t spot the sucker in your first half hour at the table, then you \nARE the sucker\u201d \u2013 Rounders \n\nEven though this quote comes from a movie, it is remarkable how \naccurate it is. It is not only important to know your skill level but also the \nskill levels of your opponents. If you find yourself in a game where you \nare struggling to see the mistakes of the other players, then it's time to \nfind a new game. \n\nIt\u2019s much better to play a $2/$5 game where you have some opponents \nwho are making clear mistakes, than a $10/$20 game that is quite tough. \nEven if you have the money for the latter, your hourly will be higher in the \n$2/$5 (possibly even positive as opposed to negative). \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nA variety of tactics can be used to recognize weaker players in a game. \nThe first one is great because of its simplicity. Think of everything you \nlearned in The Lab \u2013 if you see your opponent going against the advice \nlisted here (limping in, playing too loose, always chasing draws no matter \nwhat odds), then you know they are a weak player. You should be taking \nmental notes as you see people play. \n\nShowdowns are the best opportunities to evaluate your opponents\u2019 play. \nThe Lab has outlined what a solid, calculated, winning strategy should \nlook like. \n\nWhen your opponents get to showdown and you see their hands, then \nconsider the way they played them: does it seem like they are thinking \nabout the game intelligently? After the hand, you should think \u201cAhh, \nyeah, that makes sense\u201d or \u201chmmm, that was a bit questionable on the \nturn.\u201d As you make these notes on players, you will piece together the \nway that they view poker and build an evaluation of their games. \n\nThere are essentially two ways to make mistakes in poker: you can be \ntoo tight or too loose. If a player is too loose, then they can often \nmassively lose. If a player is too tight, then he will lose at a small clip. \n\nIt is much better to be in a game with 5 strong players and 1 very loose, \nweak player, than to be in a game with 3 decent players and 2 players \nwho are too tight. \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nIn time and with experience, you will learn to gauge these factors and \ndetermine the most profitable game for you. You will also learn that which \nseat you are in plays a role in which game is most profitable. \n\nSeat selection is a very important part of poker. \n\nThe general rule is: \n\nWe want to sit to the left of loose players and the right \nof tight players. \n\nBy being to the left of loose players, you maximize the amount of pots \nyou will play against them, doing so in position. \n\nFor the players to your left, however, you want to be tighter. By the \nplayers to your left playing tighter, you minimize the number of times you \nare reraised and called, playing fewer pots out of position. Tighter play to \nyour left also allows you to steal the blinds much more effectively. \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nLet\u2019s examine two similar games to see this scenario in action. Consider \na game where there are 5 players other than you, 4 average players and \n1 quite loose one. If you are to the loose player\u2019s direct left, you will be \nvery confident that you will be a big winner in the game. \n\nIf, however, the loose player is to your left, then you will be less confident \nabout your winrate, to the point where you may go from being a big \nwinner to a loser in the lineup. The loose player will reduce the \nprofitability of your playing hands by playing many hands in position \nagainst you in position. \n\nAs the loose player is often entering the pot, he may incentivize other \nplayers to enter the pot with hands they normally would fold. They may \nview him as an opportunity to make money, thus playing more hands for \ncall or 3-bets preflop, denying the profitability of many of your RFI hands. \n\nThis is a perfect example of the power of position as well as the \nimportance of seat selection. \n\nPoker Lab Home \n\n\u2190 Previous Lesson \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nNext Lesson \u2192 \n\nUPSWING POKER \n\u00a9 Copyright 2023 \nSitemap \nResponsible Gambling \nTerms of Service \nContact \n\nUPSWING \n\nPOKER \nMembers \n\nMerch \nFAQ \nContact \nVincent Guarnieri \nTRAINING \nARTICLES \nQUIZZES \nREVIEWS \nOUR PROS \nFREERESOURCES \nHome > Dashboard > The Poker Lab No Limit Simplified > Software by Doug Polk & \nRyan Fee \n\n Back \n\nSoftware \n\nEven though poker software may seem like a tool for strictly online \nplayers, it is one of the most important things that live players neglect. \nEven if you don\u2019t ever play a hand of online poker, you are giving up an \ninvaluable learning opportunity by not experimenting with poker software. \n\n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nHand Matrix Software \n\nThese are programs that allow you to calculate equity by picking two or \nmore hands or ranges and comparing them to each other on every \nconceivable board run out. \n\nAmarillo slim used to play a game with people back in the 70s and 80s \nwhere he would present three hands [AKo, JTs, 22]. \n\nThe game worked as follows: you each wagered some amount of money, \nlet\u2019s say $100. His opponent would always go first and get to choose any \nof the three previously stated hands. He would then choose his hand \nsecond. They would run off a flop, turn, and river. The winner was the \nperson with best hand after the five board cards were dealt. \n\nThis is a rigged game. By having position and \u201callowing\u201d his opponent the \nchoice to pick their hand first, he made himself a sure winner. If his \nopponent picked [AKo] he would pick [22]: \n\n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nIf his opponent picked [22] he would pick [JTs]: \n\nIf his opponent picked [JTs] he would pick [AKo]: \n\nAs you can see, he always picks the best hand by acting second in this \ngame. \n\nBy \u201callowing\u201d his opponent to go first, he made them enter into a game \nthat they could not win. Without the help of tools such as Equilab, it was \na very difficult problem to figure out. It is said that Amarillo figured it out \nby using brute force, running tons of boards by hands and then making \neducated guesses. We can only begin to imagine how much time this \nmust have taken for just one simple solution. \n\n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nNow just imagine the poker scenarios in which using this tool would give \nyou a massive edge on your opponent. \n\nSay you were curious about the equity of [AJs] versus [QQ]: \n\nYou could quickly and easily see that [AJs] is basically a 2:1 underdog to \n[QQ]. \n\nThe cool thing about hand matrix programs such as Equilab is that you \ncan do a hand versus a range. For instance let\u2019s say we wanted to know \nthe equity of [AJs] versus someone\u2019s 25% CO RFI range: \n\n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nOr even more complex, consider our BTN call range versus the CO RFI \nrange: \n\nNot to mention all of the postflop situations where a hand versus range or \nrange versus range calculation could be very useful. \n\nThere is no way to make these calculations on the fly or do them without \nthe help of software. Using these products is key to improving as a \nplayer. We use these programs all the time, and we will use them as long \nas we are professional poker players. \n\nPoker Database Software \n\nPoker database software are programs that aggregate hand histories \ndistributed by poker sites to sort the data of those hands in different \nways. \n\n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nThese programs organize your results so that you can see you progress \ngraphically, by stake, by position, by hole card, and so on. \n\nThese programs also help you understand trends in your play as well as \ntrends in the play of your opponents. They are absolutely mandatory \ntools for every online player. \n\nAnother reason you want to have this software is that it will display \ninformation in a chart on your table. This is called a HUD (Heads Up \nDisplay). Having a HUD gives you immediate access to your opponent\u2019s \nstatistics in a variety of both preflop and postflop situations. Players will \nhave lots of different styles. We have recommended the best styles in \nthis book. But what you really want to know is what your opponents\u2019 raise \nranges are. Having this software allows you do so. \n\nAfter playing a session, or after playing over a certain period of time, you \nmay want to see how your various decisions performed. Having access \nto your hands in statistical form lets you see outcomes. You can see how \nall of your raises from the CO went, or what your winrate is when you 3B \nfrom the SB. This will let you tailor your strategy to better suit your needs \nin your personal games. \n\nThe two primary choices for database software are Pokertracker 4 and \nHoldem Manager 2. There are other ones out there; however, these \nones are the most widely used and have the best support/updates. \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nPoker Lab Home \n\n\u2190 Previous Lesson \n\nNext Lesson \u2192 \n\nUPSWING POKER \n\u00a9 Copyright 2023 \nSitemap \nResponsible Gambling \nTerms of Service \nContact \n\nUPSWING \n\nPOKER \nMembers \n\nMerch \nFAQ \nContact \nVincent Guarnieri \nTRAINING \nARTICLES \nQUIZZES \nREVIEWS \nOUR PROS \nFREERESOURCES \nHome > Dashboard > The Poker Lab No Limit Simplified > Mental Game by Doug Polk \n& Ryan Fee \n\n Back \n\nMental Game \n\n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nIntroduction \n\nThe mental game is the final frontier in poker strategy. What we mean by \nthis is that the first steps to approaching how to become proficient at \npoker is to focus on the technical aspects \u2014 how to play strategically \nwell, how to keep improving, bankroll management, and so on. And once \nyou\u2019re strong in these areas, it\u2019s your job to always play well. That is you \ndon\u2019t tilt, you always keep maximizing expectation as your top goal, and \nyou don\u2019t search for strategies when doing poorly when seated at the \npoker table which will hopefully produce a higher win rate but which don\u2019t \nexist. That is, consistency is one of the biggest challenges you will face \nin poker. \n\nOne of the most frustrating aspects of poker is that you frequently don\u2019t \nget to see what your opponents had, reinforcing the fear that you are \nbeing overrun by a slew of loose, aggressive players. So whenever one \nof these sessions occurs, keep the following in mind. \n\n1. When it seems like a group of players is ruthlessly running you over, \nthey most likely are not. \n\n2. It\u2019s far more likely that they are just lucky, catching a number of strong \nhands in a short time. \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nPut another way, players frequently get frustrated at their extended run of \nbad luck and say things like \u201cThis guy is raising me again! The same guy! \nHe has to be bluffing sometime!\u201d And wile this may be true, deviating \nfrom what you know to be correct strategy is a dangerous game to play. \nHowever, we will often note that this is a potentially loose and aggressive \nopponent, and consider some slight adjustments. \n\nNotice above that the word \u201cslight\u201d was used. We\u2019re careful not to take \nadjustments too far because over adjusting is a dangerous game. \n\nAnd why is this the case? If our opponent knows that we are making \nspecific and drastic adjustments, especially against them, then we may \nbe playing right into their game and find that we\u2019re the one getting \nexploited instead of us exploiting them. Stated another way, avoid \nstarting a war where things can get out of hand. Be careful when feeling \nfrustrated or think that you are being run over, and remember to play \nyour best using what you know are the proper strategies (with only a \nsmall number of adjustments), and you should do this win or lose. \n\nExpectation and the Large Short Term Luck \nFactor \n\nIn our opinion, almost all poker mental game issues stem from three \nthings: The large short term luck factor (which is often measured by the \nstatistical formula for \u201cstandard deviation\u201d), the fact that games like poker \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nwhich are based on probability theory can at times be counter-intuitive, \nand that to be a successful poker player you need to play well. However, \nof the three, the large short term luck factor seems to be the one that \ncauses the most problems for the most players. \n\nIf you\u2019re a good player, expect to win. But in a game with a large short \nterm luck factor, \u201cexpect to win\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re be ahead every \ntime you leave the poker table or turn off your computer. It means that in \ntime you should be ahead, but sometimes it can be a long time even if \nyou\u2019re an expert player. \n\nAnd if this is not understood, you can be setting yourself up for eventual \nfailure. So if we get all-in with a hand like the \n\n                                                                                     \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nversus the \n\nKing of Hearts \n\n  & \n\nsuffer another loss, and then get upset, it\u2019s because we expected to win \nand probably need to improve our understanding of how strong the short \nterm luck factor can be. \n\nBut we also have our own personal expectations, and when starting out \nthey should be the easiest to deal with. If you\u2019re a beginner at something, \nthen it is unreasonable to think you\u2019ll be immediately successful. But as \nyou approach and become an intermediate player, your expectations \nmay change. That\u2019s because by understanding how to play at a higher \nlevel, you may start to string together several winning sessions, may start \nto see how and why you have an edge, and may begin to see where the \nmoney you\u2019re winning is coming from. \n\nNotice that it\u2019s here where you may first develop unrealistic expectations \nas to how much money you will win and how easy it will be. This is \n\n                                                                                     \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nanother aspect of the large short term luck factor and how it can play \ntricks on you. \n\nWhat this means is that our main purpose as poker players should be to \nwork hard on improving our strategy and mostly play only when we feel \nwe have the best of it in a given poker situation. It doesn\u2019t mean that we \ncan\u2019t take a shot, but be aware that by continuing to take shots, the large \nshort term luck factor may put us in a place we would prefer not to be in, \nand this is one aspect of controlling our mental game. \n\nPoker is a Game of High Skill, But Also a \nLot of Short Term Luck \n\nPoker is a game of high skill, but as just pointed out, it\u2019s also a game \nthat contains a large amount of short term luck, and while we won\u2019t get \ninto the mathematics of it here, luck will dissipate over time while your \nskill won\u2019t. So while both are important when looking at your results, \nespecially when the total amount of play is not that great, there is no \nsubstitute for skill. It will always prevail as long as you have an adequate \nbankroll to survive the natural fluctuations of the game. So while in the \nshort run luck is more likely to determine your results, in the end, your \nlevel of skill (whether you\u2019re a winner or a loser) will determine your long \nterm results. \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nThe particularly tricky nature of poker, as it relates to humans, is that the \nshort run can often feel like the long run. For instance, in the grand \nscheme of things, playing as many as 10,000 hands will usually not \nprovide much statistical significance. (The exception is if you have an \nextremely large skill edge over your opponents.) That is winning players \ncould easily lose and losing players could easily win over a sample of \n10,000 hands. Yes, a sample this size will grant some insight into \nsomeone\u2019s strategy and winrate, but will be a shaky benchmark to \nmeasure against. \n\n10,000 hands seems like a lot of poker. If you are playing live, where you \nget 30 hands an hour, then we\u2019re talking about 333 hours. If you play \nonline and get 100 to 300 hands an hour, then it will take between 33 to \n100 hours to achieve. Can you imagine trying to succeed at something \nfor 100 hours and failing, despite doing everything right? \n\nA few words on doing everything right: It is unreasonable and unrealistic \nto expect to always do everything right. No player has ever come close to \nalways making the correct decision. And there are reasons for this. Three \nthat come to mind are that poker is a game of incomplete information, \nthat sometimes important poker concepts which you may need for a \nspecific decision will seem to contradict each other and lead to a different \ndecision, and that your opponents are often trying to trick you. \n\nHowever, keeping this in mind, we review our play vigilantly and even \nafter being pros for the better part of a decade, we still find imperfections \nin our play that we work to improve upon. Poker is a game, but it\u2019s also a \ncontinuous learning experience. Every session should be approached as \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nan opportunity to learn something as well as a reminder that we don\u2019t \nknow everything. \n\nAgain, we want to stress that the mental game is more important in poker \nthan most other mind games (and athletic sports) because of the luck \nfactor. Poker is one of the few games where your short term result isn't \nhighly correlated to skill. By contrast, imagine a game such as chess \nwhere the short term luck factor is small. Here the better player wins with \na high frequency, and a great player will always beat an amateur. \n\nBut in poker, this is not the case. Even the best players, (and we strongly \nfeel we\u2019re part of this group), will lose sometimes to horrible players. \nThat\u2019s the way poker is and it needs to be accepted to become a top \npoker player. (It\u2019s also the hook that keeps many of the weaker players in \naction and is why the games are often good once you achieve expert \nstatus.) \n\nSo judging your skill based only on your short term results can create a \nfalse but reinforced impression of your talent. If you play correctly and \nlose, then you may be emotionally or even logically reinforcing the idea \nthat the play you made was wrong. Conversely, should you make the \nwrong play and win you, you may be reinforcing poor decisions. \n\nTherefore, to thrive at poker, it\u2019s important to be objective about your \nresults and resist the temptation to become results oriented, and yes, this \nis a difficult mindset to master. Poker can be emotionally challenging at \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\ntimes and some otherwise very talented players have not survived \nbecause they couldn\u2019t handle the natural fluctuations of the game. \n\nThat\u2019s because our minds aren\u2019t designed to think about things in such \naggregate terms. Most everyone has a breaking point. That is if things go \npoorly for some time, our brains may not be able to process the \ninformation of all the bad luck, get hung up, and tilt can set in. This is why \ngaining a strong understanding of how the large short term luck factor \nworks is so important. Now when another bad beat comes, your brain will \nbe able to process this information and move on to the next hand and \nyou\u2019ll still be able to play your best and won\u2019t doubt your own abilities. \n\nHandling Pressure and a Few Other Things \n\nWhat separates the best players from the good and even bad players is \ntheir ability to handle pressure. Funny things happen to us \npsychologically and emotionally when money enters the equation. Being \nable to remain calm and deal with pressure by making purely objective \ndecisions is how the best players create and maintain their edge over \nmuch of the competition. Those of you who are unable to do this will be \nonly marginally successful at best, and at worst will go broke very quickly. \n\nHere\u2019s an example. Suppose you lose half your bankroll and you now \nface the decision to move to a lower stakes game. If the decision is to \nstay at your current level, can you handle the pressure of possibly going \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nbroke? or if you move down, can you handle the pressure of possible \nridicule from other players who will now point out that your poker skills \nare not so hot? Poker has a way of making us feel uncomfortable on \noccasion, and those who can handle this type of pressure clearly have a \nleg up on those who don\u2019t. \n\nHowever, it\u2019s our experience that some amount of pressure at the poker \ntable is good. For instance, if you\u2019re playing in a game where the stakes \nare so small (for you) that it becomes too easy too gamble recklessly, \nthen you probably need to move up where the pressure of the amount at \nstake will encourage your best play. And if this amount is not obtainable, \nyou probably have mental game issues that are beyond this discussion. \n\nAnother important idea that is related with a strong mental game is \nawareness. It\u2019ll be difficult, especially in the beginning since there is a lot \nwe need to think about during a hand. This will be particularly true as we \nare developing our strategy, and is a huge part of the reason to work out \nas much of our in-game strategy ahead of time as possible. In addition to \nwhat hands to play preflop or what hands to bet on the flop, we want to \nbe able to reduce any unnecessary pressure and pay close attention to \nthe more subtle details of a hand. \n\nAs you become comfortable with more decisions, you can try to observe \nyour thoughts and feelings as you play. Check in with yourself every 5 to \n10 minutes to see how you are feeling, why you feel this way, and \nwhether your game is being affected in any way. For example, in the \nworld of poker there is something known as \u201cmoney management\u201d \n(which is very different from bankroll management) where the goal is to \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nmaximize the probability that you leave the table a winner. Of course this \nis usually done at the expense of lowering your long term expectation (or \nwin rate), and if repeated often can be a serious leak in your game. \n\nFinally, poker intensifies many mental game mistakes. Fortunately, these \ntype of errors are easy to fix. At least in theory they are. And usually the \ncure is to improve your understanding of all things poker including the \nshort term luck factor, how poker can be counter-intuitive, and of course \ngood strategic strategy. Then in time as your long term results become \npositive, your confidence and ability to always play well will be there. \n\nMental game issues will vary widely in how they make you feel and the \nmistakes they lead you to make. One player may begin to play recklessly \nwhile another may lose their confidence and play timidly. Poor play can \nbe caused by tilt, or it can be caused for other reasons such as searching \nbetter strategies (while at the table without thinking things through away \nfrom the table), or deciding that something else, such as getting revenge \non a player who has raised you one time too many, is more important \nthan maximizing your expectation. \n\nAs previously stated, spending some time after a session thinking about \nwhat happened during a session can have much value. This applies to \nstrategic ideas as well as aspects of the mental game. However, don\u2019t go \noverboard. Keeping track of too many things can be a burden that can \nmake poker more difficult and unenjoyable. But addressing a few \nimportant things after each session is certainly worthwhile. \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nWarm-Up/Cool-Down Ritual \n\nThere\u2019s currently a fair amount of poker mental game literature which in \nour opinion is, to be polite, somewhat confused. And the idea of a \nwarm-up/cool-down is certainly an example. \n\nWhat we think has happened is that ideas from the highly competitive \nsports world have also entered poker which is not a game that requires \nthings like speed, timing, and coordination. \n\nLet\u2019s be specific. In an athletic sport, a physical warm-up can be \nessential. This will not only help in reducing injuries, but it should also \nhelp in athletic execution and getting you completely focused so that you \ncan play your best. But in poker, how important is this stuff? \n\nWell you certainly need to pay attention, but that\u2019s not the same as hitting \na 95 mile per hour fast ball or a 120 mile per hour serve on the tennis \ncourt. But will something like a warm up have the same sort of positive \neffect at the poker table? \n\nKeep in mind that to play poker better, you\u2019ll need to play some of your \nhands differently and this new way of playing will need to be superior \nthan the way you would have played them before. In an athletic sport, \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nthere\u2019s no question that a warm up will allow you to execute better than \nyou would without the warm up. That\u2019s why when you get to a football \ngame early, you\u2019ll see the teams going through their pregame routine \nwhich allows them to block, tackle, run, throw, catch, and so on better \nthan they would without the warmup. But does something like this exist in \npoker which is mainly a knowledge game? We have our doubts. \n\nOn the other hand, getting some exercise before your play certainly won\u2019t \nhurt you, and of course the right amount of exercise is beneficial for good \nhealth. And if your ritual before you play was to review some hands, read \na chapter in a poker book, review a poker forum, or simply just breathe \nand relax, that\u2019s fine with us. And if playing online, at the start of your \nsession perhaps only play half as many tables as you normally do would \ncertainly be okay. \n\nAfter a session, you may want to take some notes, review a few hands, \ndiscuss some interesting hands with a friend, or just create a plan of \nattack for the next session. All of these should help you put poker to rest \nuntil it\u2019s time to play again, and this should also help prepare you for the \nnext session. \n\nFitness \n\nWe believe that physical fitness is an important aspect of a successful \nlife, and when you go into today\u2019s poker rooms, especially at the time of a \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nmajor tournament, one thing that you\u2019ll notice is that many of the best \nplayers are also in good physical shape. But is this a legitimate statistical \ncorrelation? \n\nOne person who has his doubts is Mason Malmuth in his book Real \nPoker Psychology and who spent many years working as a professional \nstatistician. Mason points out that people who stay physically fit often \nalso have well structured lives. That is these are the type of people who \nwill study poker and spend the time necessary to become top players. \nYes they may also be playing because poker is fun, but they\u2019re well \naware that it\u2019s more fun to be a long term winner than a long term loser, \nand are willing to put the work in so that they maximize their chance of \nbecoming an expert player. On the other hand, a couch potato who won\u2019t \nfind the time to exercise, probably won\u2019t find the time to improve his \npoker game other than osmosis at the poker table. \n\nOne area related to poker where being physically fit may be helpful (to \npoker) deals with the being mentally tired as opposed to physically tired. \nThis is discussed in more detail in the next lab, so let\u2019s just say here that \nif you have been putting much time in at the poker table, week after \nweek, or perhaps many long days in a major tournament, you may begin \nexperiencing being mentally tired, and we suspect that being physically \nfit may be helpful. \n\nSo what\u2019s the answer? While we certainly highly recommend physical \nexercise and agree that many top poker players are physically fit, it\u2019s not \nnecessarily a necessary condition to become a good poker player. But \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nwe still recommend it just for the other long term benefits that a good \nexercise program can have. \n\nPoker Lab Home \n\n\u2190 Previous Lesson \n\nNext Lesson \u2192 \n\nUPSWING POKER \n\u00a9 Copyright 2023 \nSitemap \nResponsible Gambling \nTerms of Service \nContact \n\nUPSWING \n\nPOKER \nMembers \n\nMerch \nFAQ \nContact \nVincent Guarnieri \nTRAINING \nARTICLES \nQUIZZES \nREVIEWS \nOUR PROS \nFREERESOURCES \nHome > Dashboard > The Poker Lab No Limit Simplified > Tilt and Mental Biases by \nDoug Polk & Ryan Fee \n\n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\n Back \n\nTilt And Mental Biases \n\nThe Two Baskets of Poker \n\nAlmost all games can be broken up into two parts or baskets to use a \nmore precise term. They are \u201cThe Knowledge Basket\u201d and \u201cThe \nExecution Basket.\u201d \n\nFor instance, suppose you\u2019re a good tennis player, are on the court, and \nyour opponent hits the ball over the net and now it\u2019s your turn to hit it \nback. What do you do? \n\nTwo things should happen. First, you instantly know what you want to do. \nThat is, you\u2019ll decide what spot on the court you want to hit the ball to, \nhow hard you\u2019ll want to hit it, how much and what kind of spin you\u2019ll want \nto put on it, and so on. Notice that this falls into the knowledge basket. \nNext you\u2019ll have to do this, and that requires speed, timing, and \ncoordination which of course comes under the execution basket. \n\nNow let\u2019s look at poker. It too can be thought of as having two baskets, \nknowledge and execution. But how important is speed, timing, and \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\ncoordination? While some expert players may argue that in certain spots \nwhere it\u2019s necessary to \u201cpull the trigger,\u201d the execution basket does play \na role, the vast majority of your decisions are based completely on \nknowledge and that is where we\u2019ll be looking to make our mental game \nthe strongest. \n\nThe Three Negative States of Poker \n\nVirtually everyone reading this is familiar with the idea of tilt. But this is \nactually a more complex topic than just tilt. According to Mason Malmuth \nin his book Real Poker Psychology, there are actually three negative \nstates that a poker player can enter into. Let\u2019s define them and talk about \nthem a little. \n\nA. Tilt: We\u2019re all familiar with tilt and the definition that we\u2019ll use is tilt \noccurs when a player loses his ability to think rationally, and this usually \nhappens when information is presented that a player\u2019s mind can\u2019t \nsuccessfully process. For instance, if your aces get beat several times in \na row, this can be a tilt trigger because some players just can\u2019t \nunderstand why this can happen, or perhaps why this happens only to \nthem. But of course this can happen and does happen to everyone who \nplays poker, and a better understanding of the large short-term luck \nfactor and the fact that many things based on probability theory can be \ncounter intuitive can help to solve any tilt problems. That\u2019s because with \nimprovement in this area, your mind can begin to process information \nthat it couldn\u2019t process before. \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nB. Pseudo Tilt: Pseudo tilt occurs when a player decides that something \nis more important than maximizing your expectation when at the poker \ntable. Usually this is seen when someone who is losing for the session \ndecides that getting even in his short remaining time is more important \nthan playing at his best, and thus they will begin to play much looser, \nsometimes more aggressively, and sometimes in a highly tricky manner \nthat is not warranted by the current situation. Notice that playing like this \nwill increase the probability of getting even for the session, but it should \nalso lower your expectation and if pseudo tilt occurs every so often, the \nplayer can expect to have poorer long term results. Other forms of \npseudo tilt can include locking up a win, getting revenge on an opponent, \nand a desire to brag about big wins. And notice that these incorrect \ndecisions, unlike standard tilt, are done rationally. \n\nC. Searching: This is something that occurs to marginal players. What \nusually happens is that some players who in the long run struggle to get \nresults much above break even are aware that a few of their opponents \ndo much better than them. So what frequently happens is that on those \nnights where these marginal players are winning, they play their normal \nbest game (which may not be that good but they don\u2019t know this). But on \ntheir losing nights they\u2019ll begin to search for other strategies, often trying \nto imitate what they see out of the best players. However, since their \nknowledge of poker strategy is not strong enough, they\u2019ll tend to make \nnegative expectation plays. Sometimes they\u2019ll begin to play too loose or \ntoo aggressively, and other times they\u2019ll do the opposite. But notice that \nthis is not tilt since the decision to change their strategy while incorrect is \nstill done rationally. \n\nRisk Aversion \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nAs noted above, this is a form of pseudo tilt. The volatile nature of poker \nwill sometimes leave you gun shy, and to be a good poker player you \nmust have or develop a tolerance for risk and an understanding as to \nwhy it occurs. Occasionally, when on a losing streak you become less \nwilling to bluff, value bet, or call because doing so in the past has not \nworked out well and it has been negatively reinforced. \n\nBut what has really happened is that you are beginning to question your \nknowledge or understanding of what the correct strategy should be. This \nis why to be a successful poker player you need to understand not only \nhow to play well but what the proper concepts are for any situation, and \nto also gain a strong understanding of how the large short-term luck \nfactor can affect your short-term results and the fact that poker can be \ncounter-intuitive in many spots. \n\nOver and Under Confidence \n\nA big problem occurs in poker when we are unable to distinguish how \nskillful we are and how much luck played a role in the outcome of a \nsession. This can lead us to becoming overconfident when winning and \nunder confident when losing. The former fosters unnecessary risk taking \nbecause of an inflated sense of how often we will win and can encourage \nof us to play in very tough games where our expectation will only be \nmarginal at best, whereas the latter will lead to the avoidance of risk \ntaking in situations when it would be profitable. \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nBurn Out \n\nOne of the great misconceptions in poker is that you can\u2019t do well if tired. \nLet\u2019s look at this a little more closely. \n\nSuppose you\u2019ve been playing poker all day, are tired, but before leaving \nthe poker room you spot an excellent game where if you were fresh your \nexpectation would be high and there\u2019s a seat open. Should you pass on \nthis game because you are now tired? \n\nThe answer is in most cases you shouldn\u2019t if playing in good games is \nsomething that\u2019s important to you. While you might not do (in the long \nrun) as well in a spot like this if you were fresh, you should still expect to \ndo fine. So what about being tired? \n\nOne way to look at this is that there are two ways to be tired \u2014 physical \nand mental. And they are much different from each other. \n\nWhen physically tired, while you may want to go to sleep, you should be \nable to still think well. Thus passing up a good poker game can be a \nmistake. But if you were to stay up for two days straight, now you would \nbe mentally tired and your poker decisions, as well as your results, can \ncertainly deteriorate. \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nBeing mentally tired can also occur if you were to put in long hours week \nafter week. While it\u2019s difficult to say how many hours of poker over a long \nperiod of time may be too many, it\u2019s our opinion that if you were to play \n50+ hours a week and keep doing this nonstop, then eventually you \nwould be in a mental fog. Even 40 hours a week may be too much for \nsome players (providing they keep it up) since poker requires the ability \nto make lots of tough decisions and the constant pressure of doing this \ncan wear some poker players down. So while poker is exciting, \nchallenging, and fun, it can also be long term taxing. That is while it\u2019s \nimportant to understand the difference between being mentally tired and \nphysically tired, keep in mind that if you do get mentally tired, taking a \nshort break from poker can be worthwhile. \n\nCognitive Biases or Understanding the \nShort-Term Luck Factor \n\nPoker is an objective and mathematical game, yet humans are subjective \ncreatures. Cognitive biases occur when you use the sample of \noccurrences that happen to you and assume them to be fact. For \ninstance, let\u2019s say you get aces three times in a session and lose all \nthree times. A cognitive bias would occur if you were to think that aces \n(a.k.a. the best hand in hold \u2019em by far) is a bad or weak hand. \n\nIt\u2019s also important to understand that poker has a large short-term luck \nfactor and this is just one example, while an important one, of the \nproblems that it can cause to an aspiring poker player. On the other \nhand, this large short-term luck factor is the hook that keeps many bad \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nplayers at the tables because they can remember their winning sessions \nor the big pots they won when they showed the better players how this \ngame can be played. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that statistical theory tells us that the large short-term \nluck factor will dissipate over time while your expectation should remain \nconstant (providing your understanding of poker stays the same). So if \nyour long term results are not what you think they should be, your \nstrategic game probably needs some work. \n\nThe Gambler's Fallacy \n\nIt\u2019s been red 9 times, so it has to be black next. This mistake occurs \nwhen independent events, such as a hand of poker, happen to favor one \nparticular outcome in the short run, thus validating this outcome to either \nbe unrealistically likely or unlikely to happen in the future. For instance, \nlet's say that your flush draw missed the last three times. It may \nencourage you to think that \u201cit has to happen this time\u201d and to play your \nhand more aggressively. You may also think \u201cI never get there with my \nflush draw,\u201d forcing you to fold a hand incorrectly that should have been a \ncall or a raise. \n\nClearly this is another example of the large short-term luck factor at work \nin poker. Sometimes it can seem like you never make a hand and other \ntimes it can seem like you never miss. But that\u2019s just the way poker is \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nand these short-term runs are no reason to get away from what you \nknow to be good strategy. \n\nConfirmation Bias \n\nThis is where you accept all evidence that confirms your preconceptions \nwhile ignoring everything that disproves them. This is common in all \naspects of life, but it is particularly costly in poker due to the large \nshort-term luck factor that can fool you into thinking that something is \ntrue when it\u2019s not the case. \n\nThis can be troublesome when assessing your own skill. It may be easy \nto convince yourself that you won because you outplayed your \nopponents, but when you lost it was because you were unlucky. And this \nsort of thought process is harmful because it may discourage you from \nimproving if, in your mind, the only reason you ever lose is because you \nare unlucky. Both of us continue to work hard on our game to this day, \nand you should do the same. We have also noticed that this particular \nbias is extremely pervasive with low stakes live players. \n\nThe Outcome Bias \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nOne of the hardest to develop but most important mindsets in poker is \nbeing able to avoid fixating on results. The outcome bias occurs when \nyou place too much emphasis on the outcome of hands, thus becoming \nresults oriented, and of course you should now recognize that this is \nanother example of the large short-term luck factor at work. \n\nThe DunningKrueger Effect \n\nOne of the great ironies of life is that sometimes stupid people walk \naround thinking they are geniuses, while some highly skilled people can \nbe insecure about their abilities. This is called the DunningKruger Effect. \nThe more skill you have, the less confidence you have in that skill \nbecause you are aware of your weaknesses and a lesser skilled person \nwouldn\u2019t see these deficiencies at all. \n\nThis effect is one of the reasons that poker is such a profitable game. \nWhy? Because the game is so rich and complex unskilled players may \nnot realize its depth, causing them to overestimate their abilities and \nsimplify the game. People who accuse poker of being all luck or that it is \nmainly a \u201cpeople game\u201d are simply stating how little they actually know \nabout it. \n\nThe Sport Fallacies \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nIf you go back to our first entry in this section, we talked about the two \nbaskets of poker. Recently, many ideas related to the mental game have \ncome into poker from the sports world. These can include things like \nrelaxation techniques, certain types of warm ups, special diets, and \nshowing gratitude for the good things in your life. \n\nWhile it\u2019s our opinion that most of this stuff won\u2019t hurt you, it won\u2019t have \nmuch value either. But if it gets you to lock into this stuff and you neglect \nthe process of improving your understanding of all things poker, then in \nthe long run it can hurt a lot. \n\nPut another way, many of these ideas should help an athlete with things \nlike speed, timing, and coordination because stress can be reduced and \nimproved concentration (sometimes called focus) can perhaps occur \u2014 \nthink about trying to hit a fast moving tennis ball. But also notice that \nthese ideas from the sports world mainly help with the execution basket \nmentioned previously, and remember that poker is mainly a knowledge \ngame that falls into the knowledge basket.. \n\nPoker Lab Home \n\n\u2190 Previous Lesson \n\nNext Lesson \u2192 \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nUPSWING POKER \n\u00a9 Copyright 2023 \nSitemap \nResponsible Gambling \nTerms of Service \nContact \n\nTransitioning from the \u2018category system\u2019 to a more \u2018theory based\u2019 strategy \n\nIn this section of the module we are going to take a look at the main difference between these \ntwo different ways to play poker. We are going to talk about the simplified system of ranking \nyour hands by strength, and transition to playing different scenarios according to how your entire \nrange wants to play. To use a very common phrase, we are going to learn how to \u201cplay our \nrange, not our hand.\u201d \n\nI want to start off by talking about several different concepts, and how these concepts affect how \nwe play our range. \n\nThe \u2018nut advantage\u2019 \u2013 for those that are unsure of what this term means, it is essentially which \nplayer has more combinations of the strongest hands in their range. While you\u2019d be forgiven for \nthinking that the preflop aggressor always has the nut advantage, there are many different \nscenarios in which the preflop caller will contain more combos of the nuts in their range. There \nare some instances in which the preflop caller will be the only player to contain any nutted \ncombos in their range. Let\u2019s take a look at several different scenarios\u2026 \n\nSRP \u2013 EP vs BB \n\n642r - as we can see from our preflop charts, the EP raiser has no 22/44/53s, whereas the BB \nhas all these hands in their range. The BB also has more high equity hands like 54s, 64s, and \n52s. This means that, whilst the EP raiser has the strongest overpairs in his range, the nut \nadvantage lies with the BB. We can take a quick look in the solver to see just how much this \naffects the UTG\u2019s cbet strategy in this situation. As we can see, despite having around 53% \nequity, EP is almost never cbetting this texture. This is a perfect example of how the nut \nadvantage affects our strategy as the preflop aggressor; in this instance, because of just how \ndrastic the nut advantage is for the BB, the UTG player cannot cbet this board. \n\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nKQ8r \u2013 in this instance, it is of course EP who has the nut advantage, as the BB will 3b \nKK/QQ/KQs almost always. Whilst this is an obvious example of who has the nutted advantage, \nit does give an insight into how the solver will play when it has a nutted advantage. If we look at \nthe solve, we can clearly see that the solver is betting very frequently, and that it is using a \nlarger sizing. There are some instances, like this one, where we will use a larger sizing in certain \nspots to press our nut advantage. I have re-run this sim with only 75% for the BB, and we can \nsee that it still bets extremely wide, even with only one size. \n\n3BP \u2013 SB vs BTN \n\nAK8r \u2013 as we can see from our preflop charts, the SB has a very significant nut advantage on \nthis board. The BTN will 4b AA/KK/AKs always, and almost always with AKo. The BTN does \nhave a small amount of AK and 88, but the SB has these hands at a much higher frequency \nalong with their AKs/AA/KK. The solver\u2019s strategy in this spot is to bet extremely wide (as \nbefore), but it favours a 33% size this time. \n\n854fd \u2013 if we refer back to our preflop charts, we can see that in this instance the nut advantage \nlies with the BTN, although it is a little closer in this example. The SB 3bets 88 always and 55 \nsometimes, but the BTN has 88/55/44/76s/54s always, and again has some high equity hands \nlike K6s and 76s always. \n\nWe have seen the solver use two different sizes when it has the nut advantage as the preflop \naggressor, in the SRP IP it preferred 75%, but in the 3BP OOP it preferred 33%. It might feel a \nlittle daunting knowing when to use a small size and when to use a larger size when you have \nthe nut advantage, but we\u2019ll cover the difference between those two scenarios as we go along \n(hint \u2013 it\u2019s to do with being IP and OOP!). \n\nThe \u2019equity advantage\u2019 \u2013 this is really quite simple, whichever player has more equity with their \nrange holds the equity advantage. Again, the preflop aggressor doesn\u2019t always have an equity \nadvantage (and that will dictate how we play). Please also note that if a player holds the nut \nadvantage, they don\u2019t necessarily hold the equity advantage (we can refer back to 642r to see \nthis). \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nFor this subsection I am going to use some different spreadsheets that I have used in previous \nmodules. We are going to look at BTN vs MP SRP. As we can see from our spreadsheet, the \nequity advantage is nowhere near as clear as you may think. The \u2018A high\u2019 boards are a great \nexample of how skewed it can be. If we look at the \u2018middling/low\u2019 boards, we can see that, even \nthough the OOP player has many of the nutted hands, the IP player has a clear equity \nadvantage on ALL of these boards. Furthermore, we can see from this spreadsheet just how \ndefined our strategy is as a result of this shift in equity. \n\nUsing the category system on a board like T64fd, we would always bet our category one \nhands (JJ-AA, sets, top pairs with a good kicker). As we can see, this board is not good \nfor our range, and we are going to shift our strategy to thinking about how our range \nwants to play, instead of just playing our hand. \n\nGeneral Bet Sizing Schemes \u2013 the category system gives us a great blueprint for categorizing \nour hands by strength, but it doesn\u2019t go into detail about different sizes we want to use. I want us \nto transition to a strategy that is based on the texture of the flop, and not based on the strength \nof our hand. For some of us that might feel a little unusual at first, but remember that we are \ngoing to start focusing on how our range wants to play, and not our hand. We will only have one \nbet size on any flop, and we want to get into the habit of learning what the preferred bet size is \nbased on the flop. \n\nFor example, if we open the BTN, the BB defends, and the flop is Q72r, our preferred bet size \nhere is 33%. It doesn\u2019t matter if we are betting with AA, QQ, JTs, Q4s, A5o, K5s etc. We have \none size on this flop, and it is always 33%. Another example, if we open the BTN, the BB \ndefends and the flop is 852fd, our preferred sizing in this situation is 75%. If we are betting with \n88, T8s, A4s, K9o, QJs, 33 etc, we only ever bet 75%. In the following parts of this module we \nwill learn what flops prefer what sizes (and why). \n\nAfter we are familiar with what bet sizes are preferred on what flops, we will start to think about \nthe frequency at which our range wants to bet. In the two examples above, we bet Q72r around \n95% of the time, but on 852fd we are betting around 50% of the time. The Q72 type boards are \nrelatively simple, and we can simplify further and just bet our entire range a lot of the time, \nhowever the boards like 852fd that we cbet less frequently, we will need to learn what our \nbetting range looks like, and what our checking range looks like too. \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nWe will get to a place where we have a three-step-thought-process of \u201cwhat is my \npreferred sizing on this board\u201d ---> \u201chow often does my range want to bet\u201d ----> \u201chow \noften does my hand want to bet\u201d. \n\nLink to spreadsheet with  flop and equity: \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTM2fLrmxhXG7Iu7OvqPLiBU3fLYnqYsxg_\nTpi037tat48qUL6MkfNbgHaMgZI2iIYDuQZlZ7a9zmNA/pubhtml \n\n2 \u2013 IP as PFR vs BB \n\nIn this subsection we are going to take a look at two different flops in detail BTN vs BB SRP, and \ndissect what our strategy looks like. Before we look at the flops in question, I want to use a \nspreadsheet from a previous module that I made so that we can start to get an idea of what our \noverall strategy looks like in this specific spot. \n\nI have covered this in depth in my previous modules for Upswing so I\u2019m not going to spend too \nmuch time going over it. As we can see, the solver is a bit erratic with regards to its preferred \nsizing in each spot. We need to view the data and create our own strategy that we think is most \noptimal. The reason I say this is because it is extremely important advice going forward, and for \nanyone who is new to solvers/this method of studying, it is really important that we do not try \nand replicate the solver. We want to use the information at hand as a guide and come up with a \nsimplified way of playing. \n\n For example, if we look at the \u2018broadway low\u2019 section of our spreadsheet, if we look closely we \ncan see that the solver likes to use 33% on a board like K62, but a board like K87 or J75 that \nhas more straight draws, the preferred sizing is 50%. These are the trends that we are looking \nfor when we are studying. \n\nOur betting frequencies and sizing schemes do change quite a bit depending on which position \nwe open from, but I have covered the differences in previous modules, so after you have \nfinished this module, please do move on to the other modules. One covers cbetting IP, and one \ncovers cbetting OOP. \n\nLet\u2019s take two different boards and break down exactly what our strategy looks like on the BTN. \nI want to compare our solver-based strategies with our previous \u201ccategory system\u201d, but we won\u2019t \n\n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\ndo this in this part of the module, as they are really quite similar when IP. A quick reminder of \nwhat our thought process will soon look like\u2026 \n\nWe will get to a place where we have a three-step-thought-process of \u201cwhat is my \npreferred sizing on this board\u201d ---> \u201chow often does my range want to bet\u201d ----> \u201chow \noften does my hand want to bet\u201d. \n\nPlease also remember that on certain boards like Q42 and J62 it is completely okay to bet your \nentire range. If the solver is betting around 80% of the time, you can just simplify and bet \neverything. \n\nQ65fd \u2013 we are betting around about 60% of the time on this board. In any scenario where we \nare betting between 40% and 80% of our range, there are several categories of hands that go \ninto our checking range. These are our weakest top pairs, our immediate underpairs to the \nhighest card, and our complete air that have no/minimal backdoor draws. Note that on \nQ65fd there are very few hands that have no backdoor draws, so we can use K83fd as a great \nexample of hands like J6s, Q4s type hands that so rarely want to bet. There are two other types \nof hands that we want to check, and these are our hands with reasonable showdown, and \nour weakest 2nd/3rd pairs. As we can see from the solver, hands like AT and KJ are getting \nchecked much more than a hand like JTs. \n\n863fd \u2013 whilst this is a very different board to the above, we still want to check the same types of \nhands that we normally would. We can clearly see a trend developing on what our checking \nrange looks like. This applies to all SRP cbets IP. Even though the equity is closer on this board, \nthe nutted advantage is still with the IP player (both players have all the sets, top two pair, but IP \nhas the strongest overpairs here \u2013 sometimes the overpairs don\u2019t count towards the nutted parts \nof our range but on this board it does). On these lower textures, it\u2019s imperative that we follow the \nrule of \u201cthe more connected the flop, the more frequently we check\u201d. \n\n3 \u2013 OOP as PFR as BB \n\nSimilarly, we are going to look at two different textures and compare what our strategy looks like \nfrom the BB. Before we delve into two boards, I want to briefly talk about a difference in our \nstrategy from the BB vs BTN and vs MP; when the BTN opens and BB defends, we have two \nvery wide ranges going to a flop, whereas when MP/UTG opens and BB defends, these are two \nrelatively narrow ranges going to the flop. This means that BB vs BTN, we have more TPs on a \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nboard like K72 or J43, and therefore we raise more frequently for a smaller size (more TPs in \nour range = less polarised). BB vs BTN we defend as low as K7o, but BB vs MP we don\u2019t have \nanywhere near as many top pairs in our range, and therefore we are raising a lot less frequently, \nfor a larger, more polarizing size. \n\nK63r \u2013 if we think about our category system, we would assume that 33, 66, K6s and K3s would \nbe our main category one hands, however BB vs BTN we need to widen our category one \nhands a little, and include hands like KQo/KJs with a BDFD. Our value range is easy to work \nout, and while our bluffing range looks a bit daunting in the solver, we can keep it nice and \nsimple. Instead of raising hands like Q4s or A5o, we can simply choose our highest equity bluffs \nand keep it simple. All OESDs, and our gutshots with a BDFD work perfectly. For some nice \nboard coverage purposes, we can also include some bottom pair combos with a BDSD/BDFD. If \nwe compare this board and K74fd, our bluffing range looks very similar here; we want high \nequity bluffs like A2ss, A6ss, OESDs, combo draws, and again some bottom pairs with \nbackdoor draws. \n\n863fd \u2013 I want us to still think about the category system for this specific flop, but as we\u2019ll see in \nthe solver, our category one hands play extremely differently based on several factors. Let\u2019s \nwork out what our category one hands are here; they would be 88/66/86s/33, which is not that \nwide to be honest. If we were to be using the category system, we would raise our category one \nhands here always. Switching to a more theory based strategy, we can actually see in the solver \nthat we don\u2019t raise these hands very often at all. It\u2019s really important that we understand the \nreasons behind this. Firstly, on a board like K63, our opponent has way more top pairs in his \nrange, which means we can raise our category one hands almost always because he is going to \ncontinue so much more often. Secondly, and most importantly, our opponent\u2019s cbet size dictates \nour raising frequencies; when people bet smaller, we get to raise more often, but vs larger bet \nsizes we want to be raising less frequently. If we were to force the BTN to use an incorrect size \nof 33%, we will see that our raising frequency goes from 6% to 15%, which is an unbelievable \ndifference. \n\nAnother spreadsheet: \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQej12vMR88uwu4qnLGhW3RRu4E-6O0V\nE0o3-ZFWc5LbmqGBuioMk2GfGUFybThjOQ9POOQ94S_A_47/pubhtml \n\nOOP As Preflop Raiser Vs BTN in SRP \n\nAgain, I am going to raid a previous module I have done for UpswingPoker. We are going to \nlook at two different boards, and compare our category strategy to our newer strategy. I am \ngoing to choose MP vs BTN for this part. \n\nT93fd \u2013 so we\u2019re going to start with the lower board this time. Again, let\u2019s start off by working out \nour category one hands. We open TT/99/T9s in MP always, and 33 sometimes. I think AA-QQ \ncould also be classed as category one hands here too. Again, with our previous system these \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nhands would be bet always. As we can see from the solver, our entire range wants to bet so \nvery infrequently here. This is quite a shift from the category system, and again, it\u2019s really \nimportant that we understand why this is. We can use the spreadsheet from my previous \nmodule to see that the middling/low boards all get played very passively OOP. The reason for \nthis lies in the equity columns; as we can see we are doing really poorly on these boards, even \nas the preflop aggressor. The reason for this is that our range is relatively wide here (opening \n22% on average), and the BTN\u2019s range is quite narrow (around 5.5%). We therefore have quite \na lot of air in our range compared to the BTN, and therefore our equity goes down. Another very \nimportant reason for us checking so much OOP is because we are OOP, and we want to cbet a \nlot less overall (there are so few boards where we bet really wide). OOP + a minimal equity \nadvantage = an extremely wide checking frequency on these boards. We generally simplify our \nstrategy and check our entire range on these T high and below boards. \n\nKJ3r \u2013 as mentioned above, we want to play more passively when we are OOP, however there \nare certain types of boards that we can still bet really quite wide. These are going to be double \nbroadway boards that are quite disconnected. A board like KJ3 or QJ4 are really quite \ndisconnected, but a board like KJ9r (with a flopped straight possible) or QT6fd (which is \ndeceptively connected with all of its gutshots and FDs). As we can see from our spreadsheet, \nthe data does appear a little erratic. All we can do is come up with our own simplifications as \nbest we can. Note that we get to bet much wider on Kxx than Qxx because we open hands like \nK7s but not Q7s (so have more top pairs in our range). If we refer back to what we learned in \nthe IP section of this module, the three types of hands that we check are the same: our weakest \nTPs, our immediate underpairs to the highest card, and our complete air. There is a fantastic \nexample of our complete air on this board; 54s can turn so many straight draws, so it bets \nalmost always. 65s can turn some straight draws, but not as many, so it bets a little less, and \n76s can turn so few straight draws, so it just never bets. In game, ask yourself how much equity \nyour hand can turn, and if the answer is a lot you can bet your hand really quite wide. \n\n5 IP As Preflop Caller On BTN \n\nAs we\u2019ve just seen, there are certain boards that are good for the OOP player, and certain \nboards that are bad for the OOP player. This means that the boards that are good for the OOP \nplayer are bad for the IP player, and the boards that are bad for the OOP player are good for the \nIP player. This may seem obvious once it has been said, but this helps us to think about what \nour strategy will be like on certain textures. If our opponent should bet a lot on KJ3r, our strategy \nwill clearly be to do a lot of checking back when checked to. On the flipside, if 632 is a bad \nboard for our opponent, then our strategy will involve a lot of stabbing here. \n\n \n \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nWe\u2019re going to look at two boards that are quite different in texture, but very similar in equity for \nthe IP player. This will give a great insight into the difference between our differing strategies \ndepending on the texture. \n\n743r \u2013 MP opens 33/44/77/65s pure, but BTN doesn\u2019t defend these hands 100% of the time. \nThis means that the OOP player has the nut advantage here, but given that 1) he is out of \nposition, and 2) we have the equity advantage, OOP is forced to check a lot on this board. As \nyou can imagine, we do a lot of stabbing here as the IP player. We want to stab hands like 76s, \n55, A7s, our marginal one pair hands that want to mainly get value, but also a little bit of \nprotection. In a spot like this where we are stabbing quite frequently with so much of our range, \nwe choose a 33% size. \n\nA62fd \u2013 Similarly to the above board, the IP player has a small equity advantage here. Our stab \nsize, however, is a much more polarizing 75%, and we stab at a much lower frequency. The \nreason for this is that our more marginal one pair hands are not betting anywhere near as often \nas they are on a board like 743. Look at our weaker top pairs and our middling PPs. There\u2019s so \nmuch less value to be had here, so we bet less, and when we bet less frequently, we use a \nlarger stab size. \n\nThat\u2019s a great insight into our sizing scheme, and as we\u2019ve seen we still bet all of our category \none hands here at almost pure frequency (and we are going to simplify and bet our category \none hands here always). The trend that we have seen so far is clear; in SRPs when we are IP, \nwe are betting all of our category one hands always, and a lot of our category two hands, and \neven our category three and four hands where relevant. When we are OOP, however, we must \ntake the previously mentioned factors into consideration before we decide to bet or raise our \ncategory one hands. \n\n6 3BP IP as PFR board \n\nAs we have seen from our SRP strategy, we are never checking our category one hands when \nwe are IP (and even betting a lot of our category two/three/four hands when the board is \nextremely favourable for us). This trend is going to continue in 3 bet pots for specific boards, but \nthere are some boards where we do have to play more passively with our category one/two \nhands. We also do a lot of cbetting in 3bet pots, even on the boards that are not as good for us \nas others. What I want to do for this section is take a look at two different board types, and talk \nabout our sizing schemes/betting frequencies on each. I\u2019m going to use BTN vs CO to keep \nboth players\u2019 ranges nice and wide. \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nBoards that are good for the IP player \u2013 there are a lot of boards that we can simplify and bet \nour entire range on. Any K high/Q high/J high board is great for us, and we keep our strategy \nnice and simple, and bet 33% with our entire range. If we look at our spreadsheet, we can see \nthat we aren\u2019t betting the A high boards as much as you might think. The really disconnected \nboards like A83r and A62r are getting bet around 70% or so, but the FD boards and the more \nconnected A87 type boards are not flops we want to bet too often. Let\u2019s take a look at one in \nparticular and break down why that is\u2026 \n\nA65r \u2013 there are several reasons why we want to check more often on a board like this. Firstly, \nlet\u2019s talk about protection. On Q62r, our 77-JJ region benefits from cbetting to protect from Kx \nand Ax turns. On A high boards, there isn\u2019t really any protection gained from bad overcard turn \ncards. Secondly, whilst we do have a significant equity advantage, our opponent has more \nflopped top pairs on A high flops as opposed to K/Q/J high flops. On Q62r your JJ is much less \nlikely to run into top pair than it is on A62r. Lastly, on Q62r we have a lot of bluffs that have nice \nequity. We have a lot of A5s/AJs that can turn a bunch of straight draws/FDs/has an overcard, \nbut on Axx our higher equity bluffs are fewer and far between. All these factors mean that we \ncannot cbet as wide on A high boards as we might have initially thought. The general trend is \nthat when the board is wetter/more connected we have to check more frequently. On a board \nlike A83r we can bet really quite wide, but on boards with FDs/SDs/both, we can\u2019t cbet as much; \nthere are many more hands that will continue on a wetter board, and we have less fold equity, \nso can\u2019t bet as much. \n\nWe are going to look at one specific board in a moment, but I want us to return back to our \nspreadsheet and analyse a general trend for the lower boards (10 high or lower). The solver \nlikes to split between using a 50% and a 75% bet size here, but for simplicity I think using 50% \nis fine (note that using 33% on these lower textures is not an optimal strategy). As we can see \nfrom our sheet, there is a very clear trend: the wetter/more connected the flop, the more \nfrequently we check. There is a huge difference between how we play T96fd and T83r. The \nreason for this is that our opponent holds the nut advantage on many of these flops, and also \nthat there are a lot of bad turn cards for us, so we like to pot control a little more. We can see \nthat we are supposed to check extremely often on the 6 high and below boards. \n\n732fd \u2013 I have purposefully chosen this flop as it is quite \u2018in-the-middle\u2019 of these middling/low \ntextures. We don\u2019t quite bet as wide as we would on T42r, but we don\u2019t check as much as we \nwould on 654fd, so it\u2019s a nice in-between example. Our category one hands here are really quite \nnarrow; given we have one set and no 2pairs, it would be 77/QQ/KK/AA. As we can see, the \nsolver bets these hands at a high frequency, but not always. The reason it checks some of them \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nis because of how narrow our betting range is; if we were betting here 70% with our range we \nwould bet our nutted hands always. Let\u2019s use 875fd as another board we can analyse. As we \ncan see, the BTN is supposed to check back virtually everything because of how bad a board \nthis is for them. Whilst that is a strategy we can build towards, it\u2019s not something we can \nimplement straight away without learning first. We want to look for trends and make \nsimplifications to our strategy, and the strategy is clearly that we want to check more often on \nthe boards that are extremely connected\u2026 \n\nT42r \u2013 betting 80% of our range, we bet our category one hands always, and our category \ntwo/three/four hands quite often \n\n732 \u2013 betting 50% of our range, we bet our category one hands quite often, and our category \ntwo hands quite infrequently \n\n875fd \u2013 betting 2% of our range in theory, we want to bet our category one hands infrequently \nalong with some of our higher equity bluffs. \n\nThe summary to this, and it is very important, is that the nut advantage/equity advantage lies \nwith the OOP player on these lower/middling textures, and it dictates how often the IP player \ncan cbet. \n\nPlease also note that this applies to BTN vs CO, where the two ranges are really quite wide. If \nwe think about a spot like MP vs UTG, where UTG doesn\u2019t have sets/flopped straights at \nanywhere near as high a frequency, and MP has a lot less air in their range, MP would therefore \nget to cbet much more than what we have seen above! \n\nSpreadsheet: \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12OT7f3t4BK6EiYYk6k2MMABoQT5P-cUA/edit#gid=5\n23385011 \n\n7 OOP as PFC in 3BP \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nSimilarly to our SRP OOP subsection, if we are transitioning away from the category system, we \nwill once again have some situations where we are not check/raising our category one hands at \na pure frequency. We\u2019re going to determine when that is, and more importantly, why that is. \n\nK85fd \u2013 if we refer back to the SRP part of the module, you\u2019ll remember that we could x/r a \nboard like this at a high frequency with our nutted hands because 1) our opponent has so many \ntop pairs in their range that it\u2019s more likely they continue, and 2) our opponent was using a \nsmaller cbet size, and we get to check/raise more often vs a smaller cbet size. Similarly, to \nsome examples that we\u2019ve seen, our category one hands also include our TPTK, which in this \ninstance is KQ. I also want to talk about some hands that may be perceived as category two \nhands. You might think that a hand like 77hd would be a completely fine call here, but as we can \nsee, the solver is pure folding it. This is a really common leak that people have OOP in 3 bet \npots, and it\u2019s something that we can plug quite easily by starting to fold our really marginal PPs \nthat are 3rd pair/4th pair with no backdoors. You\u2019ll see that 99 is basically always continuing, \nand that\u2019s simply because 77 and below are all losing to 8x, but 99 is ahead. \n\nLet\u2019s break down our category 3 hands here. This is a really common trend that serves us well \nin SRPs and 3bps. As we can see, our AQcc/AJcc/ATcc raise very infrequently, but our NFDs \nwith the lowest kicker are our main bluff raising candidates. The reason for this is that AQcc \nblocks QJcc/QTcc/Q9cc, but A3cc doesn\u2019t block any inferior FDs, and the solver loves to get \nvalue with NFDs vs weaker FDs. In SRPs we would also have hands like K2cc as well to raise \nwith at a very high frequency. The solver also likes to use some bottom pairs with no BDFD at \nsome frequency, but if we\u2019re uncomfortable with that/unsure of how to proceed on turns we can \nsimply raise our higher equity category three hands like those mentioned FDs and of course \nsome OESDs/combo draws. \n\n732fd \u2013 as we can see, we are raising our category one hands (only really sets here) at a high \nfrequency, but not quite as high as the K85fd board. As mentioned, our opponent has less TPs \nin his range, which is the reason for not check/raising at as high a frequency. Our category two \nhands like to do some raising for protection/value here, and the same rule of thumb applies to \nour FDs in terms of favouring the FDs that can dominate other FDs. \n\n8 3BP OOP as Preflop Aggressor \n\nI\u2019m really hopeful that the general trend will be quite clear here. There are going to be boards \nthat are really good for us as the preflop aggressor, and we get to bet these extremely often. \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nThere are some boards that are so good for us that even if we have a category four hand, we \nget to bet it. On the flipside, there are some boards that are quite poor for us, and we have to \nplay differently compared to how we normally would with our category system, particularly OOP. \n\nI\u2019ve mentioned this several times already, but it\u2019s definitely worth repeating at this stage of the \nmodule \u2013 we want to transition from a strategy that involves using sizes/frequencies based on \nour hand strength to a strategy that revolves around how good or bad the board is for our entire \nrange, and taking it from there. \n\nInstead of taking up time with a board like KJ4r, let\u2019s remember that K high, Q high, \ndouble broadway boards, and high paired boards are extremely good for us, and we get \nto bet very wide for 33%. Let\u2019s instead spend our time looking at boards where we don\u2019t \nbet our entire range, and subsequently use larger betsizes. \n\n962fd \u2013 there\u2019s a relatively loose rule of thumb when it comes to playing 3b pots: high boards \nare great for the aggressor, middling boards are reasonable for the aggressor, lower boards are \nnot as good for the aggressor, with the general trend on the middle/low boards being that the \nmore connected the board, the less good it gets for the preflop aggressor. This type of board is \na middling board, but not as connected as some other boards can be, and therefore we get to \nbet wider than we would on something like T76 or 652. As a result, we get to bet very wide on \nthis board. We\u2019re not quite range betting, so we do mix in some low frequency checks with our \ncategory one hands (66, 99, QQ-AA). The beauty of being OOP here is that we get to \ncheck/raise these hands. Our category two hands like 88, TT, JJ, Q9s are betting essentially \nalways for protection. Note that on these J high/T high/9 high boards we are favouring a 50% \ncbet size. It\u2019s really important that we are not using a 33% cbet size on a board like this \nOOP, as our opponent will get to float us so unbelievably wide, and make our lives a \nmisery OTT. \n\n753r \u2013 before we look at our strategy, please note that the optimal cbet size on 8 high and below \ntextures is 75%. I have purposefully chosen this texture because, whilst it is a very \nlow/connected flop, there are no flopped straights possible, and there are no FDs possible. With \nthat in mind, we can see that the SB is supposed to check here around 60% of the time. If we \nwere to choose something like 632fd our checking frequency would be higher. The lower/more \nconnected the flop, the more frequently we check! \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nWe\u2019re doing a lot of checking here, and that involves a variety of hands, so I want to focus on \nwhat we do after we check. Let\u2019s break it down into two different categories\u2026 \n\nWhen the flop goes check/check \u2013 as we can see, after the flop goes check/check, we are \nactually supposed to do a lot of checking again on lower cards. Our betting frequency increases \non overcards to the board, and the Tx-Kx region gets bet the most. As for our sizing, we are \nleading out for 133% pot. The reason for this is that 1) our range checks so much on the flop \nthat we still have strong hands in our range, and therefore can support this size, and 2) these \nturn cards are really good for us. \n\nWhen we check, and IP stabs \u2013 this might initially look really quite daunting, but we\u2019re looking \nfor trends/simplifications that make things really quite simple. Our value is very easy to work out, \nwe check/raise our category two hands (high category 2, low 1) virtually always, and our \ncategory one hands at a high frequency. The reason we don\u2019t raise our category one hands \nalways (55/77/AA) is simply because they need no protection, and we want to allow our \nopponent to bluff into us on a variety of runouts. In terms of what our category three hands do \nhere, it\u2019s really quite easy to work out what hands do/don\u2019t want to raise. We have very few \nnatural bluffs here (natural = high equity like FDs/OESDs etc), so we want to check/raise hands \nthat can turn equity. Look at our T8s for example, it can turn so much equity on a variety of turn \ncards, and that is what we\u2019re looking for when we have no natural bluffs. The more equity we \ncan turn, the higher our x/r frequency. T8s, T9s, Q9s can all check/raise the flop, pick up equity, \nand continue to barrel when they do so, but KQs/KTs can not turn anywhere near as much \nequity, and therefore the solver does not check/raise these hands. \n\nRemember we are not pure checking 753r, so we need some bluffs to cbet the flop with, and \nthis is a really great rule to remember \u2013 our flop cbet category three hands and our flop \ncheck/raise category three hands are relatively similar; we are looking for hands that can turn \nstraight draws and flush draws. \n\n9 3BP IP as the Preflop Caller \n\nThis part of the module isn\u2019t going to be as long as the others and the reason for this is that we \ndon\u2019t really play much of a raising range IP in 3bet pots. OOP we very much have to, because \nour nutted hands don\u2019t want to check/call and allow our opponent to check back the turn, but IP \n\n  \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nwe get to dictate what happens if OOP checks the turn. Let\u2019s take a look at two different boards \nand talk about a few different things. \n\n753r \u2013 as we know, our opponents should be playing a high check frequency on a board like \nthis. Let\u2019s take a look at what our stabbing range looks like when checked to on the flop. Given \nwe know that this board is not great for OOP and they use a larger bet size when cbetting, we \ncan work out that it is a pretty good board for us, and we want to stab wider as a result, and \ntherefore our stab size is 33%. We want to stab hands that can turn equity, similarly to the \nOOP\u2019s cbet and check/raise strategy. It\u2019s really important that we are stabbing quite wide in this \nspot. \n\nWe do play some raises in this spot, and it\u2019s extremely ABC what our raises are. We raise our \noverpairs (the stronger ones the most), and any high equity bluff we have like A6s/A4s/A8s. \nWhen our raising range is narrow, it is very ABC. \n\n962fd \u2013 similarly to the above board, we do a lot of stabbing for 33% when checked to in this \nsituation. I want us to look at our flatting range on this texture when our opponent cbets. We get \nto float really wide with certain suited broadway combos that have backdoor straight/flush \ndraws, and also the right type of AJo/AQo combos. Let\u2019s take a look at our turn strategy with \nthese floats. If we look at the 4d turn we can see that we love to stab really wide when checked \nto with our no equity bluffs. The reason for this is that a hand like KJhh doesn\u2019t want to bet, then \nget shoved on, and have to call it off. It prefers to check back and realise its equity for cheaper. \nWhereas if we float KJcc OTF, we stab the turn, we get shoved on, we are happy to bet/fold our \nminimal equity. \n\nWe will get to a place where we have a three-step-thought-process of \u201cwhat is my \npreferred sizing on this board\u201d ---> \u201chow often does my range want to bet\u201d ----> \u201chow \noften does my hand want to bet\u201d. \n\nIf you have nut advantage: maybe try to press this advantage by using slightly higher bet size, \nso bluffs r more successful and build more money for nutted hands \n\nUpswing bet sizing link: \n\nhttps://upswingpoker.com/bet-size-strategy-tips-rules/#betrules3 \n\nVideo explaining size well: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVZ1CdESSTw \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nTo succeed longterm be focused on learning and not money/!!! \n\n- \n\nIf you wanna make money, gotta improve or others will take ur money.

Hero raises to $4.50. SB calls. \n\nFlop ($9): Q\u2663 J\u2665 Q\u2666 \nSB checks. Hero checks. \n\nTurn($9): 4\u2663 \nSB bets $4.27. Hero calls. \n\nRiver ($17.54): 4\u2660 \nSB checks. Hero bets $20. SB calls and wins the pot with two pair: \nqueens and jacks (J\u2666 9\u2666) \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nAnalysis \n\nIn this blind versus blind 3-bet pot, AK plays more effectively as a \ncheck on the flop. We will have a number of value combos here \n(QQ, JJ, AQ, KQ, AA, KK, AJ, KJ), which we need to balance with \nbluffs as well. AK falls somewhere in between, and therefore plays \nbest as a check. \n\nWe would 3-bet a relatively wide range in this pre-flop spot, which \nmeans we have plenty of hands weaker than AK to use as bluffs. \nGood hands to bluff this flop with include suited \nconnectors/gappers such as T9, 89 and T8. Additionally, checking a \nsemi-strong hand like AK here helps us protect our flop checking \nrange. \n\nOur opponent indicated weakness on the turn, which we can attack \nwith an overbet on the river. Their line of betting small on the turn \nand checking river implies that their range is not particularly strong. \nBy overbetting, we can put a large portion of that range in a difficult \nspot. \n\nBy doing this with our strong hands as well (AJ+), we can extract \nmaximum value from our opponent when they make the hero call \nwith J9! \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nHand 5 (07:13) \nCollapse \nHero is in MP with A\u2663 Q\u2666. \nUTG limps. Hero raises to $2.25. UTG calls. \n\nFlop ($5.25): A\u2666 8\u2663 3\u2665 \nUTG checks. Hero bets $3.32. UTG raises to $6.64. Hero calls. \n\nTurn ($18.53): T\u2663 \nUTG bets $5.03. Hero calls. \n\nRiver ($28.59): K\u2660 \nUTG bets $7. Hero raises to $36.08 and is all-in. UTG calls and mucks \nhand (A\u2665 7\u2660). \n\nAnalysis \n\nOur opponent in this hand was tagged as a fish and we took a very \nexploitative line possible to extract maximum value. \n\nGiven that our opponent limp-calls at the start of the hand, we can \neliminate AK from their range with some level of certainty. This means \nthat we only lose to two pair, of which there are only 18 likely combos on \nthis board (AT, A8, and A3), but at the same time there are 56 combos of \none-pair Ax hands which we beat. \n\nBecause of our opponent\u2019s small turn and river bet sizing, as well as the \nperceived weakness of our opponent\u2019s range given the limp-call, we can \nexploitatively jam our AQ for value on this river. While it may seem like a \n\u2018risky\u2019 strategy, it makes sense (and money) when we are up against an \nopponent as weak as this one. \n\nDay 1 - Database Review Notes \nCollapse \nDay 1 \u2013 Database Review \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nWe should start by breaking down some stats gathered from our first \nday at the tables to get a sense of the general tendencies found in the \nplayer pool. \n\nYou can do this by generating a report for all players in the \u2018My Reports\u2019 \nsection of PokerTracker. One stat in particular stands out when we take \na look at at our 1000 hand sample: \n\n\u25a0  The steal success % in this player pool is fairly low so far \n\nThe steal success % of the player pool varies between 25-36% by \nposition, with the SB being an exception at 53%. This suggests that our \nopponents play a wider range of hands relative to similar stakes at other \nsites ($50nl zoom, for example). \n\nNow, lets turn around to analyze my own stats for the day: \n\n\u25a0  I played really loose pre-flop \n\nOpening to 2.2x, my raise first-in % was quite loose, raising 20% of \nhands from EP and 70% from the SB. 3-betting is pretty infrequent at \nthese stakes, so I can open a wide range with little threat of having to \nfold to a re-raise. \n\n\u25a0  My won when saw flop % was relatively low \n\nMy won when saw flop (WWSF) % came in at 49% - lower than expected, \nbut this may be an indicator of a loose-passive field with lots of \nmulti-way pots. \n\nWhile having high WWSF and hands won percentages can be a good \nindicator of success, you shouldn\u2019t change your play style to try and \nincrease them. Instead, you should do your best to play as profitably as \npossible, and hopefully these stats will come as a result. \n\n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nHero is in the BB with A\u2666 8\u2663. \nSB raises to $1.50. Hero calls. \n\nFlop ($3): 2\u2663 5\u2665 9\u2663 \nSB bets $1.90. Hero calls. \n\nTurn ($6.80): 6\u2660 \nSB checks. Hero checks. \n\nRiver ($6.80): 4\u2660 \nSB checks. Hero bets $9.50. SB calls and wins the pot with a pair of tens \n(T\u2666 T\u2660). \n\nAnalysis \n\nIn this hand, we go for an overbet bluff on the river after getting \nfavourable runout for our range versus our opponent\u2019s line. They would \nalmost certainly bet the turn with their sets and straight combos (87 and \n43) on such a connected board, meaning their range is capped\u2014 \nmedium-strength at best. Overbetting the river puts most that capped \nrange into a tricky spot. \n\nIt can be easy to get discouraged after a high-risk overbet bluff gets \ncalled, but that\u2019s counterproductive. We happen to run into the top of \nour opponent\u2019s range (TT) in this hand, but that shouldn\u2019t stop us from \noverbetting next time. \n\nHand 14 (17:01) \nCollapse \nHero is UTG with K\u2663 K\u2666. \n\nHero raises to $1.11. MP calls. BTN calls. \n\nFlop ($4.08): 2\u2660 Q\u2663 2\u2666 \nHero bets $4. MP raises to $8. BTN folds. Hero raises to $15. MP calls. \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nTurn ($34.08): Q\u2666 \nHero checks. MP checks. \n\nRiver ($34.08): 5\u2666 \nHero checks. MP checks. \n\nHero wins the pot with two pair: kings and queens (K\u2663 K\u2666). \n\nAnalysis \n\nWe go with a large pot-sized flop bet because of the range advantage \nthat we have over our opponents. As both the MP and BTN flatted our \nopen, we can eliminate AA and QQ from their ranges. This means that \nthere are very few combinations of hands our opponents can have that \nbeat us. \n\nA weaker player may flat A2s facing a UTG open, but with removal there \nare only two combos of this holding (A\u26632\u2663 and A\u26652\u2665). Instead, the \nranges of our opponents are likely to contain lots of pocket pairs \n(66-TT), as well as some Qx combinations. Our pot-sized bet will allow \nus to extract maximum value from that range. \n\nEven though our opponent raises the flop, it remains true that there are \nvery few combinations in our opponent\u2019s range that beat us here. For \nthis reason, we can exploitatively raise KK for value with hops of being \ncalled by the large portion of Qx hands that our opponent can be \nholding. \n\nHand 4 (3:40) \nCollapse \nHero is in the BB with K\u2665Q\u2666 \nSB ($25 stack) raises to $1. Hero raises to $3. SB calls. \n\n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nFlop ($6): J\u2666 8\u2665 9\u2663 \nSB checks. Hero checks. \n\nTurn ($6): 9\u2665 \nSB bets $6. Hero raises to $52.63 and is all-in ($16.06 effective). SB \nfolds. \n\nAnalysis \n\n3-betting blind vs blind when faced by a min-open is standard, even \nagainst a relatively short 50 BB stack. KQo hand is strong enough to \nextract some value while forcing our opponent to play their weak \nminraise-call range out of position. \n\nOn the turn, it is unlikely that our opponent would play their 9x combos \nin such an aggressive manner, so this bet seems like a bluff. For this \nreason, combined with the equity of our hand, raising this turn all-in \nagainst our short-stacked opponent is a strong play. It forces his \nrandom bluffs to fold, as well as weak drawing hands that have equity \nagainst us (such as KT). \n\nAdditionally, KQ blocks a number of his QJ/KJ value combos, which \nmakes this bluff get through a bit more often. \n\nHand 17 (18:55) \nCollapse \nHero is in the BB with Q\u26635\u2665 \nUTG limps $0.50. Hero checks. \n\nFlop ($1.25): Q\u2665Q\u2666A\u2665 \nHero checks. UTG checks. \n\nTurn($1.25): 9\u2665 \nHero bets $2. UTG calls. \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nRiver: 9\u2660 \nHero bets $8.50. UTG calls and mucks hand. \n\nAnalysis \n\nWhen our opponent limps from UTG, we can assume that they are a \nfishy player from which we can exploitatively extract more value by \nbetting large with our strong hands. After the action checks on the flop, \nwe overbet both the turn and river in order to put our opponent in a \ndifficult spot with Ax combos, which comprise a significant portion of \ntheir range. \n\nIt is important to understand that sometimes it\u2019s ok to throw range \nbalancing out the window and instead try to exploit our opponents as \nmuch as possible. Against weak players such as this one, playing an \nexploitative style will be the most profitable strategy even if you run the \nrisk of making your ranges unbalanced as a result. \n\nAdjusting to specific opponents based on hand histories \n\nA quick note on adjusting to players that you regularly encounter at the \ntables. For example, throughout this video you\u2019ll notice that we get into \na lot of pots with \u2018WomboComboAA\u2019 where we are called down lightly \n(especially in the last hand of the video with TT vs T9). \n\nWe should be conscious that this opponent has shown a tendency to \ncall us down lightly, and adjust our bluffing frequencies as a result. On \nrivers, we can overbet for value with our strongest holdings and \nconsider giving up with some bluffs in more marginal spots. (That \ndoesn\u2019t necessarily mean to stop bluffing altogether!) \n\nHand 12 (10:10) \nCollapse \nHero is in the BB with 5\u2666 6\u2660. \nUTG limps $0.50. Hero checks. \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nFlop ($1.25): 6\u2665 4\u2666 9\u2663 \nHero checks. UTG bets $0.75. Hero calls. \n\nTurn ($2.75): 8\u2663 \nHero checks. UTG checks. \n\nRiver ($2.75): J\u2666 \nHero checks. UTG bets $1.60. Hero calls and UTG mucks their hand (A\u2663 \nK\u2665). \n\nAnalysis \n\nThe hand starts with a limp from UTG-- a fish-tag worthy play. We have a \nclear check in the big blind and a clear call on the flop. \n\nAfter our opponent bets the flop, we would expect them to continue \nbetting with most of their straight and draws, many of which contain a \nJack (JT, QJ, J7). As a result, it\u2019s fairly unlikely the river J\u2666 connected \nwith our opponent\u2019s hand. \n\nBased on what we\u2019ve seen so far, players at these stakes seem to not \nvalue bet rivers as thinly as they should be. Therefore we can discount \nsome 8x and 9x combos from our opponent\u2019s range. \n\nDay 2 \u2013 Database Review \n\nWe played just under 2,700 hands in this session and finished up $84. \nThe main observations from today: \n\n\u25a0  Blue line outperforming red line \n\nMy overall graph shows me to be winning substantially more money \nwith showdown than without. This means that players are fighting for \npots more and calling more frequently than expected, especially \ncompared with equivalent stakes at PokerStars. \n\n\u25a0  Surprisingly stiff competition. \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nIn general, regulars at these limits are stronger than expected, at least \ncompared to other sites. To deal with this, game selection is important to \nmake sure that you can maximise your edge. \n\n\u25a0  They are not 3-betting often enough vs steals. \n\nIn terms of weaknesses, these players have displayed low 3-betting \nfrequencies from the blinds. \n\nOur button opens have faced a 3-bet just 23% of the time. That number \nis even lower when we open from the SB, with the BB 3-betting 14%. \nGiven how wide we open from steal positions, our opponents would be \nwise to 3-bet us at a much higher frequency. \n\nHero is in the BB with A\u2665 6\u2660. \nSB calls $0.50. Hero raises to $1.50. SB calls. \n\nFlop (3): 2\u2665 4\u2665 Q\u2666 \nSB checks. Hero checks. \n\nTurn (3): 4\u2666 \nSB bets $1.42. Hero raises to $5.50. SB calls. \n\nRiver ($14): J\u2663 \nSB bets $6.65. Hero calls and SB mucks their hand (T\u2665 3\u2665). \n\nAnalysis \n\nWe can discount strong many Ax hands, broadways, and pocket pairs from \nour opponent\u2019s range once they choose to limp, but a trap is still possible. \nHowever, when our opponent flats our raise rather than re-raising, we can \nconfidently remove traps from his range (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, AK). \n\nWhen our opponent leads on the turn, it is likely a bluff because of how few \nvalue combos are in their weak range. Strong Qx hands would have played \ndifferently pre-flop, and weaker Qx hands should play as a check-call in this \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nspot most of the time. Our opponent has few 4x combos, and our own holding \n(A6) blocks many of them (A4 and 64s). \n\nThe board texture presents two potential flush draws on the turn, and our \nopponent has many suited hands that are now flush draws in his limp-calling \nrange. Their pre-flop play also all but eliminates strong broadway flush draws \nfrom their range. \n\nBecause of our opponent\u2019s lack of value combos and abundance of draws, we \ncan actually raise this spot for value. It may seem risky, but our huge range \nadvantage on this turn allows us to raise with a large portion of our \nrange.  \n\nWe have a relatively easy hero-call against this small river donk-bet. We only \nhave to be good about 25% of the time for a call to be profitable against this \nbet size. The river J\u2663 does not complete any draws, nor is our opponent likely \nto lead out if he hit a pair on the river. For these reasons, we can hero-call our \nace-high. \n\nExtremely exploitative lines like this can be very effective against capped \nranges. \n\nUPSWING \n\nPOKER \nMembers \n\nMerch \nFAQ \nContact \nVincent Guarnieri \nTRAINING \nARTICLES \nQUIZZES \nREVIEWS \nOUR PROS \nFREERESOURCES \nHome > Dashboard > The Poker Lab No Limit Simplified > Making Adjustments in a \n10,000 Hand Sample <i>by Ryan Fee</i> > Day 3 \u2013 Database Review \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\n\u2190 Back To Lesson \n\nDay 3 - Database Review \n\nDay 3 - Database Review Notes \n\nCollapse \n\nDay 3 - Database Review \n\nIn this video, we take a look at the results from day 3 on PokerTracker,. \nWe also check out our overall sample for this challenge. \n\nAs the graph shows, it is completely possible to lose 9 buy-ins over 2,000 \nhands whilst playing completely fine! There are a few key things to note \nfrom this sample: \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\n\u25a0  We could have opened looser from MP, CO, BTN and SB given \n\nthe low 3-betting frequencies of our opponents. \n\n\u25a0  It might be time to tighten up vs 3-bet \n\nIn circumstances where we do face a 3-bet, we may be calling too \nfrequently given the likely strength of ranges that we are up against (we \nonly face a 3-bet when opening from the BTN 22% of the time). \n\n\u25a0  The player pool may not fold to steals, but some individual \n\nplayers do. \n\nThough the likelihood of stealing blinds is lower than expected (48% from \nthe SB), there are still may weak-tight players at this level. We can use \nour HUD stats to identify these weak-tight players and adjust our stealing \nfrequencies when they are in the big blind. Against tighter players that \ndo not defend often enough, you can profitably open a wider range \nof hands. \n\n\u25a0  We should defend our big blind a little less often in 3-way pots. \n\nOur won when saw flop (WWSF) % in 3-way pots is just 23%. (To be \nbreaking even, our WWSF % should be 33% in theory.) \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nThis indicates that we may be defending too wide of a range from the big \nblind when there is an open and a call. Because it is so difficult to realize \nthe equity of hands when out of position, defending a stronger range in \nthese situations will lead to more favourable post-flop spots. \n\nIn the second half of the video, we take a look at our entire sample for \n$0.25/$0.50 6-max at ACR. \n\n\u25a0  Over 6,000 hands, we have lost $181 and contributed $321 in \n\nrake \n\nIt is important to note how much rake you are paying and how it affects \nyour win-rate. (Without rake, we are a winning player at these stakes \nover the sample.) \n\nTo work out how much rake you are paying in BB/100, divide the amount \nof rake that you have paid (321.63) by the big blind (0.5), which comes \nout to 643.26. Divide this result by the number of hands that you have \nplayed (6249) and multiply it by 100 to get the %. \n\nIn our case, we have been paying 10.29 BB/100 in rake \u2013 a significant \namount that shifts us from a being winning player to a losing one. \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\n\u2190 Previous Topic \n\nNext Topic \u2192 \n\nUPSWING POKER \n\u00a9 Copyright 2023 \nSitemap \nResponsible Gambling \nTerms of Service \nContact \n\nHand 7 (13:16) \nCollapse \nHero is in the BB with K\u26639\u2666. \nMP raises $1.

(It is \nclear that our opponent\u2019s range is capped, as any nutted value hands \nshould be betting this connected flop.) However, in practice it is shown \nto be a -EV play versus our opponent. \n\nGiven this outcome, we should overbet bluff less often in these spots, \nand in turn widen our value over-betting range to get the maximum from \nour hero-calling opponent. \n\nHand 22 (36:42) \nCollapse \nHero is on the BTN with 5\u2666 6\u2666. \nHero raises to $1.50. BB raises to $5.50. Hero calls. \n\nFlop ($11): 9\u2660 5\u2663 7\u2665 \nBB bets $5.50. Hero calls. \n\nTurn ($22): 4\u2663 \nBB bets $19. Hero calls. \n\nRiver ($60): T\u2660 \nBB checks. Hero checks. \n\nBB wins the pot with a pair of tens (Q\u2665 T\u2665). \n\nAnalysis \n\nThis hand is an example of making the adjustment discussed in hand 7; \nthat is, toning down our over-bet bluff frequencies. \n\nThe flop is a clear call, and calling the turn is standard with third pair \nand an open-ended straight draw. If we shove the turn instead, we can \nonly expect to be called by hands that are beating us. By calling, we \nallow our opponent to continue with their bluffs while retaining a lot of \nequity versus their range. \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nWhen our opponent checks the river and we have one of the weakest \nhands in our range, bluffing would usually be mandatory. But against \nopponents that show a propensity to call down lightly, it\u2019s better to stick \nto shoving value hands only. \n\nAs the result shows, both our call on the turn and check on the river \nwere correct, and choosing not to bluff saved us the rest of our stack. \n\nDay 4 - Database Review \n\nDespite being confident with how the session played out, we finished \ndown a couple of buy-ins. However, during this review we had an \nepiphany regarding the best adjustments to make in order to crush \nthese stakes on ACR. \n\n\u25a0  We need to play tighter \n\nThere\u2019s a notable discrepancy between our hands won % and WWSF %. \nIn particular, we are above average in % of hands won, but our WWSF % \nis below it. This means that our pre-flop aggression has been profitable, \nbut once we see a flop our chances of winning the pot decline. \n\nPlayers at these stakes call too frequently and take erratic aggressive \nlines to win pots, which makes fighting back with marginal holdings \nnot-so-profitable. This is not a game in which you\u2019re likely to achieve a \ngreat red line (money won without showdown). \n\n\u25a0  Go for more thin value bets and less bluffs \n\nThis player pool can be exploited with a value-heavy strategy\u2014we need \nto bluff less and value bet more. This is not to say, however, that we \nshould never bluff. If the ideal situation presents itself, where there is a \nclear range advantage, go for the bluff. But in close bluffing spots we \nshould consider value betting thinner instead, since the field is apt to \nfrequently make hero-calls. \n\n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\n\u25a0  Don\u2019t worry about the red line; the green is all that matters. \nWith these adjustments, we should soon see a graph that shows our \nwinnings come primarily from our blue line (money won with \nshowdown), while our red line will be break-even, or just below \nbreak-even. \n\nHand 1 (00:00) \nCollapse \nHero is in the BB with A\u2665 A\u2660 \nSB raises to $1.50.

Hero bets $67.37 and is all-in ($38.50 effective). \n\nSB calls and mucks their hand (Q\u2666 T\u2666). \n\nAnalysis \n\nOnce again, the post-flop action caps our opponent\u2019s range to \nmedium-strength hands. After our opponent check-calls the turn, \ntwo-pair and sets become unlikely. \n\nThe 4\u2663 river does not connect with our opponent\u2019s range. In line with \nplanned adjustments, we can overbet the river with our strong hands \nwith expectations of getting called at a relatively high frequency. \n\n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nWe checked the flop, bet the turn, and overbet the river in a spot where \nmany draws missed (flush draws, AK, AQ and KQ all brick out). This is a \nline our opponents have frequently perceived to be a bluff. \nConsequently, we can exploit their perception by betting the river with a \nvalue-heavy range. \n\nBy overbet bluffing less in these spots (while keeping in mind the same \nconcept of capped ranges) we can overbet this river for value with our \nover pairs, two pair combos, and sets. Getting called by hands as weak \nas second pair only reinforces our adjustment. \n\nHand 12 (22:22) \nCollapse \nHero is in the BB with J\u2666Q\u2663. \nSB raises to $1.50. Hero calls. \n\nFlop ($3): J\u2665T\u2663A\u2663 \nSB bets $2. Hero calls. \n\nTurn ($7): 3\u2665 \nSB bets $5.50. Hero calls. \n\nRiver ($18): 4\u2663 \nSB bets $13.50. Hero raises to $41 and is all-in. \n\nSB calls and wins the pot with a straight (Q\u2665 K\u2663). \n\nAnalysis \n\nThis hand demonstrates the thought process behind selecting \nappropriate bluffs on certain runouts. \n\nOn the river, J\u2666Q\u2663 is one of the most suitable hands to turn into a bluff, \nsince \n\n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nwe block the second nut flush with the Q\u2663, as well as the nut straight, \nwhich means our opponent has fewer value combinations to call our \nraise with. \n\nIt is unfortunate that we run into one of the hands that we block, but the \nplay was nonetheless a strong one and not incorrect. Most players have \nunbalanced, value-heavy river raising ranges, so it is good to balance \nout your range with some optimal bluffing hands like we did here. \n\nDay 5 - Database Review \n\nIn this video, we do one final review of our database across the five \ndays. \n\nAs predicted, our adjustments were very effective\u2014we won 6 buy-ins \nover 3,000 hands in our last session, and the style changes we made are \nreflected in our graph. Our blue line (money won with showdown) is the \nmain source of income, which is what we expected by playing a \nvalue-heavy range. \n\nSome final notes about the player pool and our sample: \n\nOverall, we won 3.99 BB/100 (all-in adjusted) over 10,000 hands, and \nwith rake removed this rises to 13.99 BB/100. \n\nOur Raise First In (RFI) strategy was also effective overall. The stats \nwere as follows: \n\n\u25a0  EP = 21.30% \n\u25a0  MP = 24.95% \n\u25a0  CO = 29.59% \n\u25a0  BTN = 55.39% \n\u25a0  SB = 62.92% \n\n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nWe stole the blinds at a high frequency, in particular from the BTN (41%). \nThis is awesome news for our wide-opening strategy. \n\nIn terms of potential adjustments, we can consider 3-betting less from \nthe BTN, as well as calling less from the BB. \n\nThe important upshot from all this is that using tracking software will \nhelp you to recognize the general tendencies of players in your games. \nThen, once you\u2019ve identified those tendencies you can construct a \nstrategy that best exploits them. \n\nIn our sample\u2019s case, the adjustment was to bluff less and value bet \nmore\u2014a style that proved to be successful against our wide-calling \nopponents. \n\nGarys spreadsheet for live cash module: \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1tAo8Z5rKQPD_XxyzIFRKSLOIE7Jk0TmfZCvhKTUZ\n5dM/edit \n\nPreflop Ranges/Discussion \n\nIn this subsection we are going to look at several different preflop charts and compare \nthe difference between raked games and no rake games. I have selected 200bb stack \nsizes because I believe the average stack size will be around this. \n\nEP\u2026 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nThese ranges are relatively similar, there are a few strange anomalies in here (i.e. we can \nopen ATo in a raked game but not in an unraked game). We don\u2019t want to worry too much \nabout this, we simply want to focus mainly on hands like 22, 54s, 66, 77 etc; the \nlower/more marginal parts of our range we can open in an unraked game, but in a raked \ngame these go from being slightly winning opens to extremely \nmarginal/breakeven/slightly losing. \n\nCliffs \u2013 tighten up in raked games in EP with 22-55/54s/65s type hands. \n\nOn a slight tangent it\u2019s extremely important that we are aware of our table surroundings; \nif we have a very large fun player in the BB that we want to play with, we should open \n22/KJo type hands essentially always. We do this because we want to be IP vs this type \nof player. We simply widen our opening range and try to play more often with this type of \nplayer. This of course does not apply if this type of player is BTN/CO and we end up \nbeing OOP vs him/her. \n\nHJ\u2026 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nHere we can see a really big difference in the two opening ranges; hands like 22-44/54s \nare still being mixed in the raked game, but we open these pure in an unraked game, \nalong with hands like 97s, J8s, 54s+. There is a really big difference between these two \ncharts, and the trend is already very clear; in a raked game we want to really tighten up \nwith the lower parts of our range, even as far as the HJ.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nBTN\u2026 \n\nThis is the first part of this module where I want to talk about exploiting our opponents. \nLike all preflop charts, these ranges play against these ranges. Our opponents will not be \nas good/as aggressive as these ranges suggest, so we should not follow these ranges \nidentically. If we look at the BB\u2019s response vs a BTN open\u2026 \n\n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\n\u2026we can see that the BB is supposed to 3b quite wide. The BB is supposed to 3b hands \nlike JTs, T9s, J9s, K7s, K2s almost always. The BB is also supposed to 3b hands like \nQ8s, A6o, QTo, J7s, 63s etc at a low/medium frequency. Anyone who has played in a live \ngame, particularly a lower stakes live game like 1/2 and 2/5, knows that this just doesn\u2019t \nhappen. We know that our ranges play vs our ranges, and we know that our opponents \nwill never get close to this sort of polarized 3b strategy, so we can deviate from our \npreflop charts and open wider. We get to play more pots IP vs a wider range, our \nopponent will miss more often, and we get to cbet and make them fold more often. \n\nIf we now look at what we should be defending in the BB, we can see an extremely \nsignificant difference between these two charts. In an unraked game we can defend \nhands like 86o, 97o, 95s, T4s, A3o etc. In a raked game, however, defending these types \nof hands will significantly eat into our winrate. This is a leak that many of us can plug in a \nraked game, and it will immediately increase our winrate. We can start to fold hands like \nK8o, 65o, 32s, 42s etc. Before seeing these charts these are hands that I personally \nwould have happily defended with, but as we can see these are clear folds and we really \ndo need to tighten up when defending the BB. \n\nBB vs MP\u2026 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nAs we can see again from these charts we have to be extremely tight in a raked game, but \ncan continue to defend quite wide in the unraked games; hands like 54o, 65o etc are \ncomfortable calls in an unraked game, but in the raked game we can\u2019t even defend \nKTo/QJo/K3s etc. \n\nI want to address the white text in the two above screenshots; the BB vs BTN defence is \nsolved for 2.5x open, and the MP vs BTN defence is solved for vs 2.25x open. These are \nclose-ish for a 2/5 game (where people generally open to 3x-4x, however it goes without \nsaying that for a 1/2 game the general open is much bigger. If people do open bigger, we \nneed to tighten up our defence frequencies even more than the above screenshots \nsuggest, because our immediate odds and our implied odds are not as good. We can use \nthe above charts as a very nice guide but in a 1/2 game it goes without saying we need to \ndefend a little tighter. \n\nGeneral miscellaneous discussion for preflop opening strategy\u2026 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nIn unraked games the preflop raise size is generally consistently smaller, however in \nraked games people seem to want to raise to 5x/6x always. Let\u2019s buck this trend and start \nto adjust our raise size depending on what position we are. I no longer want to see a 5x \nraise UTG/UTG+1 in a 1/2 game. Let\u2019s replicate the online strategy of using a smaller \nraise size in EP. The reason we do this is very simple; we are going to be OOP a lot, and \nas a result we want to keep the size of the pot smaller. We also save money for the times \nthat we get 3b and have to fold. Let\u2019s use a 3x size in EP, a 4x size in MP and a 5x size in \nLP.  \n\nIf you are playing on a very loose table where people are calling lots preflop multiway \nyou want to tighten up your opening range, particularly from early position. If you are \nplaying on a tight/passive table, you tend to open wider as you are more likely to steal \nthe blinds or get yourself HU with the players in the blind. \n\nExtremely important that we are aware of who is at our table and adjust accordingly. E.g., \nif there is a big fun player in the blinds, we tend to widen our opening range to play with \nhim/her. Alternatively, if there is a very aggressive reg on the BTN we should aim to \ntighten up our opening range as we know he/she will defend/3b more and make our life \nquite difficult OOP. \n\nSRP Flop Strategy \n\nIn this subsection we are going to look at a few different scenarios. \nWe are going to look at cbetting multiway, cbetting HU when we are \nOOP, and cbetting HU when we are IP. A lot of us play both live and \nonline, and in this video we\u2019ll see that we cannot just implement the \nsame strategy in both environments, we need to adjust accordingly. \n\nCbetting HU \n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nWe are going to look at two different scenarios here and talk about the \ndifference between live and online in our strategies. We are going to \nlook at cbetting OOP (EP vs BTN), and cbetting IP (BTN vs BB). \nPlease note that what we are looking at is not strictly related to EP vs \nBTN only for example, we can apply this to EP vs CO, UTG+1 vs BTN \netc. It\u2019s not about memorizing exact strategies for exact positions, but \ninstead getting a feel for what our strategy looks like overall. \n\nEP vs BTN \n\nThere\u2019s a big difference between the way we play middling/low boards \nand the way we play single/double broadway boards. As we can see, \nwe are checking EXTREMELY wide on 9 high and below flops, to the \npoint where we can just simplify and check these always. This is to do \nwith how little 22-77 type hands we open, and how many hands IP has \nthat connects with this type of board. The ten high and 9 high boards \nare getting bet a little more frequently, but we are still checking these \non average around half the time. \n\nIf we look at the single broadway and the double broadway boards, \nwe can see that we want to be betting these MUCH wider. The J high \nboards/wheel A high boards appear to be higher frequency checks, \nbut the K high, Q high disconnected, and double broadway textures \nare really good for our range and we bet them really wide as a result! \n\nPaired boards are played similarly to the above strategies; the \nlower/connected boards get cbet a lot less than the higher paired \nboards. \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nLet\u2019s delve into 2 different boards within the solver and investigate\u2026 \n\nK86fd \u2013 If we quickly take a glance at the spreadsheet we can see that \nthere is a very clear trend; the more connected the flop, the more we \ncheck. So a board like K42 which is very disconnected gets bet \nvirtually always, but a board like this that is more middling/straight-y \ngets checked a little more frequently. It\u2019s really important to know \nwhat our checking range looks like, and it\u2019s really easy to see that it is \nhands that have no immediate equity or backdoor equity. Note the \ndifference between A3dd and A7dd. We also balance our checking \nrange with some of our weaker top pairs, and our immediate \nunderpairs to the highest card. Checking our nutted hands like 88/66 \nis completely dependent on who our opponent is; if it\u2019s a \nloose/passive type player who won\u2019t stab much then this would be a \ndisaster spot to check. If it\u2019s an aggro LAGgy type player who stabs a \nlot, then we can check this hand (and always x/r). \n\n952r \u2013 whilst in theory we should check our entire range here, I have \npurposefully chosen this flop to talk about 1) why we might not want \nto do that, and 2) what our x/r range is going to look like. Whilst we \nacknowledge that on these low boards the IP player is doing much \nbetter than on a board like K72r (the equity is almost even), our live \npoker opponents will not stab anywhere near as much as the solver \nwill, so we miss value with our nutted hands. We want to check more \noften on these boards, but it would be a mistake to check our entire \nrange. We can check our entire range on boards like 765 or 854, but \non a semi-connected board like this we want to be betting around 30% \nof the time. \n\nWhen we do check, let\u2019s take a look at our check-raising range. As we \ncan see it is not that wide at all, and that is because of how deep we \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nare. It\u2019s really important that we check raise less often on these more \nconnected flops when we are deeper because of how vulnerable \ncertain hands in our range become. We want to favour hands that \nhave more equity/can turn more equity for our bluffs, and we want to \nchoose our sets/AA-TT type hands for our value. \n\nBTN vs BB \n\nFor this scenario, I have deliberately widened both ranges; whilst we \nalready know that the BB should defend tighter because of the rake, \nthe reality is that our opponents will not know/do this, and they will \ndefend a wider range. I have widened the BTN opening range to \nreflect the fact that, as discussed, the BB will not 3b even close to \ncorrectly and as a result we get to see more flops IP vs a wider range \nand win more money overall. \n\nOur strategy mirrors our online strategy here quite a lot, the \ndifference is that, whilst we still have a wide checking range, we get to \nbet much wider on the middling/low textures than we would online. \n\nI recommended in the first part of the module that we want to widen \nour BTN opening range because people will not 3b correctly. People \nwill not raise our cbets correctly when we do cbet, and therefore we \ncan cbet wider than the spreadsheet/solver suggests. We can use \nA82r as a great example of how much the BB should raise vs our \ncbet, but in reality, it\u2019s just never happening, and therefore we want to \nbet wider. People will also fold hands like 96ss, JTo etc, so our wide \ncbet strategies will be printing. \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nThe single broadway textures are quite interesting, according to the \nsolver/sheet we should be checking back quite a lot. I think that that \nis fine on Q high/J high boards that are connected (we want to check \nback around 50% on average) but on the Q high disconnected, K high \nand A high boards, we want to be betting these really quite wide. \nWhen it comes to choosing a preferred bet size, the solver is acting \nquite erratically. I think it\u2019s best to be using a 33% cbet size on these \ntextures (and bet wider than the solver suggests). As we know, our \nopponent has lots of air/won\u2019t xr correctly, so we want to bet small, \nand bet often. \n\nLet\u2019s take a look at a couple of different boards to get an idea of what \nour betting/checking ranges look like\u2026 \n\n862r \u2013 if we look at the equity on average that we have in the \nmiddling/low section of our sheet, we can see that our equity is lower \non these types of flops than it is on a KQ4r type board for example. \nThis obviously means that we have to do more checking. Our \nchecking range on these boards is quite easy to work out once we get \nthe hang of it; we want to check a bunch of our AK-A9, KQ-KT type \nhands, and a lot of our complete air like Q3s hands. If we have a \nbackdoor combo draw like Q7ss we can bet that really quite wide. We \nmix in some checks with our weaker top pair (as standard), and while \nthe solver loves to check back AA to protect its range on future \nstreets, this is just not going to be an optimal strategy in live poker; if \nwe force the flop to go x/x we can see that our opponent should be \nleading a ton with their straight draws, gutshots, 3rd pairs etc. It just \ndoesn\u2019t happen, and therefore we miss value on the flop. \n\nAQ9fd \u2013 It\u2019s really hard for us to have complete air on 862, we always \nhave a backdoor something or overcards. On this texture, we have \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nmore air in our range and these are the hands we should be checking \nwith. As discussed, we want to be betting wider here than the solver \nwill want to, and we can bet with our FDs/BDFDs always, but give up \nour trash hands with no BDFD. So, 64ss/64hh we can bet almost \nalways, and 64dd/cc will always check back (note that just because \nwe check back the flop with these doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t bluff the \nturn/river with them). We also want to pure bet our gutshots/OESDs \non these types of boards. Basically, we want to up our betting \nfrequencies with stronger draws/backdoor draws, and give up a \nbunch with our hands that have no backdoor draws at all. \n\nCbetting multiway \n\nThere are many different scenarios in which we can be \u2018multiway\u2019. We \nare going to focus on the difference between being OOP to most of \nthe remaining players in the hand, and being IP to most of them. \nThere is no accessible solver available to me for running multiway \nsims, so we\u2019ll have to use some intuition to work out what our general \nstrategy is going to be. \n\nIn terms of what sizing scheme we want to use, we have two different \nflop sizes when we bet: 33% and 50%. We use the smaller size on \nboards we want to bet wider on like KQ2, A83, K42, and all \npaired/monotone boards. We use 50% on boards that are not going to \nbe bet all that often like 842, T65, J86 etc. Note that your 50% size can \nbe 66% if you wish, but we don\u2019t really love ploughing money into the \npot multiway, and thus a smaller \u201clarge size\u201d will be more beneficial. \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nMultiway OOP \u2013 when there are more players in the pot our equity \ngoes down. This means that we have to be significantly tighter when \nchoosing hands to cbet, regardless of the board. There are certain \nboards that we can cbet wider that are better for our range, and \nobviously there are some boards that are not as good for us. We can \nuse Equilab to give a great indication of how our equity goes down \nwith more players in the pot. \n\nSummary \u2013 we want to bet wide with high equity bluffs, hands that \ncan turn equity (e.g. T9ss on 842sdc), and we want to protect our \nchecking range with some hands like top set, bottom set (to x/r with) \nand our top pairs with the weakest kicker. \n\nMultiway IP \u2013 it\u2019s not often that we\u2019ll find ourselves multiway and IP vs \nboth the blinds, but it does happen sometimes. We want to cbet at a \nvery high frequency on boards that are very good for us, like double \nbroadway, K72r, A94r, high paired card type boards. We can protect \nour range by checking back some of our top pairs with the weakest \nkicker, and some immediate underpairs to the highest card (e.g. 99 on \nT52). We do not want to do ANY slowplaying at all in position in live \npoker. Whilst this may work occasionally, it is a far higher EV strategy \nto cbet our strongest hands instead of checking them back for \ndeception. \n\nTurn SRP Strategy \n\nHeads Up Turn Strategy \n\nTurns rly rly good for range: can do more low equity bluffs \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nIP \u2013 it\u2019s really uncommon to see turn overbets in SRPs at lower stakes \nlive games. This is something we absolutely should be doing (in the \ncorrect situation), so let\u2019s know when to do it and add it to our \narsenal. If we look at boards like K74r and K53fd we can devise an \nextremely solid turn strategy straight off the bat. We like to bet 75% \non certain straight completing/all flush completing turn cards, as well \nas board pairing cards. We very clearly prefer an overbet size on brick \nturn cards. On these higher textures there are many brick turns, so we \nneed to take a look at some of the lower/more connected textures. \n\nOn a board like T52fd we can see that we bet 75% on the flush \ncompleting turns, 133% on the brick cards, 133% on J, Q, K turns, and \n75% on A turns. If we look at a texture like 842fd we can see that the \nsolver wants to overbet some overcard turns and bet 75% on other \novercard turns. It\u2019s quite erratic, and quite tough to derive a set \nstrategy that is simple and easy to follow. My advice is going to be to \nfollow the rule of T74fd; we want to overbet all the bricks, and all the \nJ, Q, K turns. We want to bet 75% on 4 card straight turns, flush \ncompleting turns and board pairing turns. We also want to bet 75% on \nA turns. The reason for this is that if we look at what the BB calls OTF, \nhe has more Ax that will call the flop than Kx/Qx hands. For that \nreason we don\u2019t want to overbet into a range that has a decent \nnumber of turned top pairs on T52A. Our opponent has way less \nturned TPs on T52K, T52Q etc, and that\u2019s why we can overbet those \nturns. \n\nWe also get to find low equity turn bluffs on these types of boards. As \ndiscussed, on K723 the turn is not that great for our range and we \nhave to give up with T8s type hands, but on 842Q, we have so many \nmore turned TPs than our opponent, so we get to barrel hands like \nK3s with no FD etc. \n\n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nPaired boards are going to be very heavily favouring a 75% turn size. \nWe can use 883r and 877fd to see this. Monotone boards also favour a \n75% turn size. \n\nOOP \u2013 if we refer back to our previous scenario of EP vs BTN, we can \nuse several different flops to investigate what our general preferred \nturn sizing should be. Using K42, 844 and T42 we can see that our \nonly turn size is 75%. If we subtree on T429 for a 33% size, we can see \nthat the solver will actually prefer a 33% turn size a lot of the time. \nWhilst this will be correct in theory, I don\u2019t think this is the most \noptimal strategy and we should almost always use a larger size of \n75%. Note that we are not overbetting ever OOP, and this is because \nwe are OOP and want to control the size of the pot! \n\nFor turns: Bet valued hands, and hands with flopped or turned equity \nlike fd, oesd, gutshots with overcard, combo draws. \n\nFor multiways: way more checking, more selective with bets. Tighter, \nand lower bet sizing. \n\nBB SRP Strategy \n\nIn this subsection we will spend some time looking at our general \nstrategy in the BB in SRPs. \n\nDefending Preflop \n\n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nAs discussed previously we need to tighten up our defending range in \nthe BB in raked games. I have used the BB defending ranges vs HJ to \nillustrate the point that in raked games we want to underdefend more \nthan anything, whereas in unraked games we can slightly overdefend. \nThe rake is an incredibly significant factor in our decision making. \n\nI don\u2019t have multiway defence charts to illustrate the point I want to \nmake, but I cannot stress how important it is that we don\u2019t defend \nsuper wide from the BB multiway because we think we are \u201cpriced \nin\u201d. A lot of hands like QTo, 84s, 87o, A7o etc look like they might be \nprofitable to call from the BB after an open and several calls, but the \nreality is that we actually have to defend quite really quite tightly in \nthis spot. Take a hand like QTo for example, in a multiway spot these \nunsuited low broadway hands like this are going to be dominated very \noften, and so rarely do any dominating themselves. KJo/KQo are \nreasonable defends because they will have some of your opponents\u2019 \nhands dominated more often than not. Hands like 64s are fine to \ndefend, but the super unconnected suited hands like 84s, T2s etc are \nnot profitable defends. We can significantly increase our winrate by \nnot bleeding from the blinds in multiway pots. \n\n^HUGE LEAK for lots of players \n\n3betting preflop \n\nI want to re-visit our BB strategy vs BTN with regards to rake/no \nrake\u2026 \n\nIf we look at the chart on the left this is really quite similar to an online \nBB vs BTN 3b chart, with a ton of J9s, T9s, suited broadway type \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nhands in there. As we can see from the chart on the right there is a lot \nmore \u201cunusual\u201d 3betting going on. Hands like A6o, A4o, A2s, K3s \nbecome relatively marginal calls because of the rake, and they are \ntherefore more incentivised to take the pot down preflop instead of \ngoing to a flop with $17 in it and having $5 taken out of the pot. Whilst \nthese ranges are obviously incredibly hi-tech, remember our \nopponents will not play like these ranges. As a result we probably \ngenerate less fold equity than these ranges suggest, and I am going \nto strongly recommend focusing on using suited hands as our 3b \nbluffs. We can sprinkle in a sliver of A4o, A5o etc, but I\u2019d rather see us \nuse hands like A3s and A4s at a higher frequency, because A4s plays \nmuch better than A4o postflop, and we\u2019re going to go to a flop more \noften than these ranges suggest. Hypothetical scenario \u2013 folds round \nto BTN, BTN opens QTo, we 3b from the BB, our charts suggest that \nBTN has a very VERY clear fold, but live players will defend this vs a \n3b. As a result I want us to have hands that are stronger/flop more \nequity/backdoor equity and play better postflop. \n\nRaising cbets \n\nI\u2019m going to use a few different examples in the solver to show what \nour raising range should look like on a variety of flops. It\u2019s really \nimportant to note that the frequency we raise will be higher when our \nopponents use smaller cbet sizes. \n\n753r \u2013 this is a perfect example of the above paragraph; if BTN cbets a \ncorrect size here of 75%, we only raise around 10% of the time. If the \nBTN cbets for 33%, we are raising almost 20% of the time. That\u2019s a \nvery significant difference. If we look at our raising range vs a 75% bet \nsize, we can see that the solver will mix in some calls with sets and \ntop two pair. We can call our top set sometimes if we want to, but our \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nbottom set/middle set/top two pair/flopped straights should just \nalways be raised. The pot is small, we have a strong hand in an \nenvironment that people don\u2019t like to fold in, and we want to fastplay \nOOP always. In terms of our bluffs, we like to choose our gutshots \nthat have a backdoor flush draw and our OESDs. \n\nOur turn strategy is so easily worked out by looking at the difference \nbetween J6ss and J6dd on the Td turn. We want to continue with our \nhigher equity bluffs always! \n\nKJ5fd \u2013 our opponents will use a cbet size here of 33% very often in \nmy opinion. Firstly if we look at our value, we are raising our nutted \nhands like KJ, J5, 55 almost always. This is because of the smaller bet \nsize, where the solver doesn\u2019t like to slowplay because there is less \nmoney going into the pot. We can even raise our stronger TPs at \nsome frequency, and sometimes our weaker TPs with a FD (like \nK7hh). In terms of our bluffs, we prioritise our combo draws and our \nNFDs with lowest kickers. We also want to x/r some bottom pairs with \nno kicker with a BDFD at a relatively low frequency. This gives us \ngreat board coverage for when the bottom card pairs, allows us to \nhave some runner runner flushes, and also our low kicker unblocks a \nlot of our opponent\u2019s folding range. \n\nLet\u2019s take a look at our flush draw combos that want to raise; we want \nto use Axhh and Qxhh with the lowest kickers. The reason for this is \nthat we want to choose hands that have less SDV, but also hands that \nunblock our opponent\u2019s worse FDs; A8hh blocks 87hh, 86hh, Q8hh \netc, but A2hh/Q2hh blocks a lot less FDs our opponent can have. \nFlush over flushing people is great, and that\u2019s why the solver chooses \nspecific combos. We want to x/r our combo draws and our NFDs/2nd \nNFDs with the weakest kickers! \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nT93fd \u2013 again, our value range is very obvious here, hands like T9, 33, \nand even some TPTK. Our bluffs are going to be OESDs (particularly \nwith a FD or BDFD). \n\nThe importance in the difference in our strategy depending on our \nopponent\u2019s betsize is shown well here; if we force BTN to bet 33% we \ncan see how much we raise K2hh type hands, but vs a 75% bet we are \nrarely raising these hands. Be aware of your opponent\u2019s betsize as it \ndictates how often you get to raise overall! \n\nIt is extremely important that we understand that we want to continue \nbluffing on the turn with our highest equity bluffs. Let\u2019s look at KQ5r \nand see what turns we want to continue on with a hand like 87s. We \ncontinue to bet with our hands that have flopped a lot of equity, and \nour low equity flop raises that have turned equity! \n\n3bet Preflop Ranges \n\nSimilarly to part 2 of this module, we are now going to take a look at \nour preflop 3betting charts. As previously mentioned, there are many \ndifferent charts available for me to choose from, and I can\u2019t fit them all \ninto this module, so I am going to select as many as possible for us to \nlook at in a variety of scenarios. The two scenarios I have chosen for \n3betting preflop are SB vs CO and BTN vs MP, so one IP and one OOP. \n\nAs discussed previously these ranges have been run with 2.25x \nopening sizes, which we will never see in a raked 1/2 or 2/5 game. \nThis might be closer to true in a 5/10 or above game. We need to \nadjust in lower staked games by tightening up our 3b range and our \ncalling range too. \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nBTN vs MP\u2026 \n\nAs expected, we can see that in an unraked game we can mix certain \nhands between call and 3b. Hands like 87s, A6s, 88 are completely \nfine to 3b and call. If we look at the raked game however, we can see \nthat we must play a much higher frequency 3bet, as we are \nincentivised to take the pot down preflop more often as a result of the \nrake. We also want to be folding marginal hands like 22-55, 98s, J9s, \nAJo hands always preflop. Whilst this might seem quite tight at first \nglance, I cannot stress to you how mindful we must be of the rake. We \nreally want to be changing our game to have a lot more 3bets, a lot \nless flats with trashy hands that won\u2019t beat the rake long term, and a \nlot more flatting with the correct types of hands (i.e., folding 87s but \nflatting KJs). \n\nSB vs CO... \n\nFirstly, let\u2019s take a look at the chart on the left. We are pure VPIPing \n22+, AJo, ATo, and 54s +. Given the fact that there is no rake, we have \nsome money in the pot already from our SB, and that it\u2019s live poker \nand the BB won\u2019t squeeze as much as he should, we can VPIP really \nquite wide overall here. When you compare this chart to the raked \ngame, you can see that whilst we can do a little bit of flatting, our \nrange is still much tighter overall, and we are still incentivised to play \na higher frequency 3b with more of our range. We are looking for \nhands that play well postflop like suited broadways and suited Ax. \nHands like 87s just don\u2019t feature in our 3betting or flatting range at all \nwhen OOP. Please also remember that these ranges are set for \nsmaller open sizes, so when we do face larger open sizes, we are \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\ngetting worse immediate odds and worse implied odds, and we will \nplay very few flats indeed (and much more 3bets). \n\n3b Flop Strategy \n\nFor this part of the module I have purposefully used the Upswing \nPoker Advanced Online ranges for my sims. This is because I want to \nfocus on the raked games strategy in particular here, and as \nmentioned in the previous section, the raked ranges advocate for \nmore flatting than we should be doing because of the smaller opening \nsize. We are much more likely to face 3x/4x/5x opening sizes, and \nwhen that happens, we flat a whole lot less because our immediate \nodds aren\u2019t as good, and we are incentivised to take the pot down \npreflop more often. \n\nWe\u2019re going to take a look at two different scenarios: BTN vs MP and \nSB vs CO. Please remember that we can apply what we learn here to \ndifferent scenarios, and you are not limited to only using this strategy \nin the above scenario. For example, we can apply SB vs CO strategy \nto SB vs BTN as well. We don\u2019t spend our time learning the difference \nbetween SB vs BTN and SB vs CO, we build a solid strategy for OOP \n3bet pots vs late position, and if we want to go back and fine-tune this \nwhen we have increased our EV elsewhere, we can. \n\nFor both of the upcoming scenarios, remember that the more \nconnected the lower boards are, the more frequently we check. We \ncan bet 983r much more than we can bet 643fd! \n\n BTN vs MP \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nOur general strategy here will be to use two different betsizes \ndepending on the texture and stack depth. The first size will always be \n33%, and the second size will be between 50% and 66%. More \nadvanced players can add sizes like 25% and 75%, but we can use \njust two sizes and devise a solid, simple strategy. Before we break \ndown some flops/boards to look at, let\u2019s take a look at our \nspreadsheet. We can see that we want to bet smaller on A high \nboards, double broadway boards, monotone boards, and paired \nboards where the paired card is high. We want to bet our 50-66% size \non single broadway boards, and middling/low boards. From an \nexploitative point of view, we want to bet wider than this spreadsheet \nsuggests, because the OOP player will not raise anywhere near as \nmuch as they should. We can use A94fd to see just how wide the \nsolver will x/r this flop, and if we compare that to our opponents in a \nlive game, we realise that this will never happen, so we can cbet \nwider. \n\nWe\u2019re going to look at two different flops. I have purposefully chosen \ntwo flops where we don\u2019t bet our entire range so we can focus on the \nrange that wants to check back. \n\nJ65fd \u2013 this is a great indication of what our overall x/b strategy \nshould look like. If we\u2019re ever in a spot where we don\u2019t bet our entire \nrange our x/b range is really quite consistent. We want to x/b our \nweakest TPs (we can use A73fd as a better indication as we have \nmore TPs in our range on this type of board), some of our 2nd/3rd pairs, \nsome of our AKss type hands, and some of our KTcc type hands that \ncan turn a lot of equity (they x/b the flop because they don\u2019t want to \nget x/r\u2019d). We never want to slowplay hands like AJ/QQ+ here! \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\n743r \u2013 as we know, we want to x/b more on these lower boards, and \nthe more connected the board the more frequently we check (look at \n987r and 654fd in the spreadsheet as a great example). We want to \nmix in a bunch of checks with our AQ/AK type hands on this board \nand bet our hands with less SDV (Q high, J high, T high type hands). \nOn a board like J65fd above it would be an abomination to x/b a hand \nlike AA (despite the solver wanting to do so 15% of the time), but on a \nboard like this, we are definitely allowed to x/b a small percentage of \nthe time with AA/KK. QQ-TT want to bet much more frequently as they \nneed protection from more overcard turns. The reason we want to bet \nhands like KQ/KJ and not K9/Q9 is because they have more equity \n(remember MP has JJ here, so KQ has two overcards to hands like \nthat, but has only one and that significantly reduces its equity). \n\nSB vs CO \n\nOur sizing scheme here is going to be a little different. We are still \ngoing to use the 33% cbet size on certain textures, but a larger cbet \nsize of 66-75% is mandatory when OOP. If we are IP and we cbet a flop \nlike T72 for 50%, our opponent can\u2019t float with hands like KQ, AJ, 55 \netc because they are OOP and will end up check/folding the turn so \noften. If we are OOP and we use the 50% size, our opponent can float \nhands like this much more easily and make our lives a misery OTT. It\u2019s \nimportant that we have a larger cbet size on certain textures to \nde-incentivise our opponents from floating us with higher equity \nhands like this. If we look at our spreadsheet, we can see that we want \nto use 33% on A high, K high, Q high boards, high paired boards, and \nmonotone boards. We want to use the 66-75% cbet size on J high \nboards and middling/low boards. Whilst I haven\u2019t included this in the \nspreadsheet, I am going to strongly recommend adding a 50% cbet \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nsize to your arsenal for low paired boards like T22, 866 etc. We don\u2019t \nreally want to bet big into a range which has a \u2018trips advantage\u2019, so \n50% works nicely on these boards. \n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some flops where we\u2019re not betting our entire \nrange. \n\nA76r \u2013 if we very quickly look back at our spreadsheet, we can see a \nnice easy trend for these A high boards; if the board is disconnected, \nwe get to bet very wide, but if the other two cards are more \nconnected, we want to be checking around 30% of the time in total. \nWe are happy to see that what we learned in the above section applies \nwhen we are OOP as well; we check our weaker TPs, our immediate \nunderpairs to the top card (KK-JJ in this instance), and some of our \ntrashy non-BDFD type hands like KJcc, KQo etc. \n\n632fd \u2013 if we force the SB to check here, we can see that when IP the \nsolver will stab with so many hands that a human won\u2019t. This means \nthat, whilst we still play more checks than normal on this board \nbecause we are OOP/it is connected, we don\u2019t want to check \nanywhere near as much as the solver suggests. If humans don\u2019t stab \nhands like JTs, AQo or K9s here as much as the solver will, we are \njust missing out on value with our stronger hands. If we force the \nOOP player to check, and the IP player to stab, we can see that we \nneed to play a very aggressive x/r strategy. While this might feel \ndaunting at first, we can keep it very easy/simple and x/r our JJ+, and \nour strongest FDs with 2 high cards. We can even throw in some KQ \nof BDFD, A4 BDFD type hands too. \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nT63r \u2013 the above 632fd board gave a great indication of what our x/r \nstrategy looks like, but it wasn\u2019t the best example of what our cbetting \nstrategy is (although we know that we want to cbet wider than the \n15% the solver suggested). If we look at this board here we can see \nthat our checking range is again very consistent; our weakest TPs, \nour immediate underpairs to the top card, and our A9/A4 combos with \nno BDFD just give up. \n\nLook at the board, figure out if you want to range bet, check a small \namount, or check a lot on the board. If you want to check a small \namount, think about what your checking range looks like, and ask \nyourself if your hand falls into that category. If you want to check a \nlot, be sure that you play a solid/aggressive/simplified x/r strategy! \n\nturn: continue with your flopped equity and turned equity (flopped \nfdfd, oesd, sets, and turned versions of these too.), and give up w \nhands that didn\u2019t pick up equity, unless it has blocking/removal to his \nvalue hands and doesn\u2019t block bluffs \n\n^also, we don\u2019t want to barrel with hands that block there air. \n\non great turn cards for our range we can bet a little wider w no equity \nbluffs (have good removal/blocking tho) \n\nwhen oop be more selective and tighter bc less fold equity and hard \nto get to showdown (even if bet whole range on flop), when in position \nhowever can barrel far more high equity draws/values and even hands \nw good blockage and removal of value hands and no blocking of their \nbluffs. \n\nwhile blocking and removal things are important, equity is first thing \nto pick and is more important. \n\n  \n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nGeneral River Strategy \n\n**this is for live, so if in tougher/online games can swirch to slightly \nmore bluffs and less value thin bets and so forth. \n\nThe general consensus is that people don\u2019t fold anywhere as much as \nthey should in live poker. Whilst that means that we should bluff less \nfrequently, that doesn\u2019t mean we just never bluff. We want to bluff \nappropriately in 2 different situations, 1) when we have correct \nblockers/unblockers, and 2) when the board runs out scarily for our \nopponent\u2019s range (aka in a bad way for opponent). \n\nWhile we all know that blockers are important for bluffing \nstraight/flush boards, unblockers are just as important as well. Let\u2019s \ntake a look at a board like QT2r5h7d. We can see that the solver \ndoesn\u2019t like to bluff with missed hearts ever. This is a really important \npart of river strategy, and something that you should immediately \nstart to include in your own game. Instead of using hands like A4hh \nand J9hh we can choose the combos that don\u2019t contain a heart \ninstead. Whilst in game you might feel frustrated having to give up on \nthe river with your missed flush draw, it\u2019s important to realise that that \nbluff will be much lower EV than some of the other combos we arrive \nto the river with. Hands like J9cc, K4dd, 64s are much better bluffs \nbecause of their unblockers. It's important that we find these low \nequity turn barrels with K4s/K3s type hands to allow us to have \nenough bluffs to choose from OTR. \n\n^just bc didn\u2019t hit and can\u2019t win pot, if not good blockers/unblockers, \njust let it go, don\u2019t be too tempted to bluff it to win, will be negative ev. \n\n \n  \n  \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nAlso, probably bluff less on river when board doesn\u2019t change too \nmuch. \n\nThe other scenario we want to find bluffs in is really quite \nself-explanatory; on a low type of board we want to continue to barrel \nscare cards. The solver isn\u2019t going to help us out very much with this \nriver scenario as people won\u2019t fold as much as the solver does. Take \n842fdQx for example, when we overbet this turn the solver is folding \n77 and some 8x, but in reality, our opponents are never folding these \nhands. This means that their range is wider/contains more weak \nhands when we get to the river, and we get to bluff the higher \ncards/draw completing cards more than the solver will. We\u2019ve got to \nbe quite selective with the rivers we elect to bluff in this scenario, as \nour opponents will continue to call their marginal 8x/4x/77 type hands \non brick rivers, but will be more inclined to fold on Kx/Ax/Th type \nrivers. \n\nI do not recommend trying to make live players fold 2nd pair type \nhands on brick rivers, and we should only bluff with good \nblockers/unblockers/on runouts which are bad for their marginal \nholdings. \n\nThis leads me nicely on to my next point. If we shouldn\u2019t be bluffing \nas wide as a solver would, it means that we should be value betting \nextremely thinly! \n\nLet\u2019s take a look in the solver at a couple of different instances\u2026 \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nIf we play around with T65r we can see just how wide we should be \nvalue betting with different ways we get to the river. Let\u2019s look at when \nflop and turn go x/x, we can see that the BB is supposed to block bet \nas wide as 4th pair. If we force BTN to cbet, BB call, and the Kc turn \ngoes x/x, we see that on a brick river our 77/88 hands want to block \nbet. We want to have two different river sizes, block bet(smaller) and \nbig bet. We put our weaker hands like 2nd pair, 3rd pair, weak top pair, \netc into our block bet size, and our stronger hands into our big bet \nsize. It\u2019s important we put a small amount of our strong hands into \nour small bet size so that we still induce some random raises from \nour opponents. We tend to favour our hands that heavily block our \nopponents calling range, like top two pair. \n\n^block bets r for oop p much when turn goes check check, if checks \nto ip can thinly value bet i think but thats a whole different concept. \n\nblock bets invented to prevent bigger bets on river, however now also \ncan be thin value bets \n\nIf we look at the same tree from the POV of the BTN, and we bet \nflop/turn, we can see that the solver thinks AT, QQ, JJ, K3s etc are too \nthin to value bet. This would be a mistake in live poker, and vs the \naverage poker player I would be very comfortable finding a third bet \nwith these combos for value. \n\nIf people don\u2019t fold enough, we must must must value bet thinly for \nthat same reason! \n\n^along w this should bluff a little less \n\n  \n \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nBlock betting is so unbelievably important in poker (oop), particularly \nafter the turn has gone x/x. We can see just how thinly the solver likes \nto value bet, and it\u2019s important we are finding these thin bets.  \n\nDeepstack Flop Strategy \n\nWe are going to look at our 3bet pot flop strategy for BTN vs MP and \nSB vs CO and compare the difference to our regular 200bbish \nstrategy. \n\nAs mentioned previously, I have run my sims with a 33% and 66% size \nto give a little space between the two sizes. At 200bb and below, when \nwe are IP we can use 33% and 50%, but when we are deeper, our IP \nsizes will be 33% and 66% (we need a little more fold equity when \ndeeper hence the larger size). \n\nBTN vs MP \n\nAs we can see from the spreadsheets, the boards that we cbet at a \nvery high frequency at a normal stack size adopt a similar strategy \nwhen deeper; we want to bet really wide on K high, Q high, double \nbroadway, and high paired boards. As we know, J high boards will \nalways be more connected than a Q high or a K high board; you \ncannot have an unpaired J high board that doesn\u2019t have at least one \nstraight draw. We cannot bet J high boards as liberally as Q high & K \nhigh boards, and when we do bet, we want to use the larger cbet size. \n\nAnother very significant difference in our strategy when deep is how \nmuch more reserved we must be on the middling/low textures. As we \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\ncan see from the sheet, we are supposed to check any board that has \na flopped straight possible at a VERY high frequency, and 3 liner \nboards like 765, 654 etc are just pure checks. The overall higher \nfrequency checking strategy is because of how vulnerable the \nstronger parts of our range are. At 150bb effective, for example, we \nare pretty happy to bet/get-it-in with AA on 853fd, but when we are \n300bb, 400bb deep this would be far less appealing. The equity of \ncourse doesn\u2019t change at a deeper stack depth, but the vulnerability \nof our range definitely does. \n\nWhilst we absolutely do not want to check as wide as the \nsolver/spreadsheets suggest, we MUST play more conservatively on \nthese boards and check much more often than we would at a \nshallower stack depth. We want to be selective with our bluffs, and \nmore conservative with our overpairs (particularly the overpairs that \ncan lose to our opponent\u2019s overpairs (so 99 on 852 loses to TT/JJ/QQ \nthat our opponent can have so we play that a little more passively). \n\nThe solver is checking back any low board that has a flopped straight \npossible with its entire range. Whilst we want to up our checking \nfrequency on these types of boards, we only want to check our entire \nrange on a 3 liner to a straight. So on 854 we can bet around 30% of \nthe time, but on 876 we want to check back almost everything. I\u2019d \nrecommend betting my sets/T9s here, and maybe some AK/AQ \nflush-draw combos, and that\u2019s it. We really don\u2019t want to worry about \nbalance in this exact spot, and bet our nutted hands and our high \nequity bluffs. \n\nSB vs CO \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nThe first thing I want to address (that ties in nicely with the above \nsubsection) is the difference in how we play monotone flops when IP \nand when OOP. As we can see from the two spreadsheets, when we \nare IP we get to barrel these monotone flops really quite wide, but \nwhen we are OOP we have to be much more cautious and do a bunch \nof checking. This is for two reasons. Firstly, the vulnerability of our \nrange on a variety of runouts, and secondly because of the range \nconstruction of this spot; CO has a bunch of flushes that we don\u2019t \nhave (like 54s, 65s etc). We get to bet a little wider SB vs EP on \nmonotone flops, but we have to be very cautious SB vs BTN, BB vs \nCO etc at this deeper stack depth. \n\nAgain, there are a lot of similarities to our regular stack depth strategy \nand our deeper stack depth strategy; we get to bet really wide on the \nsingle broadway, double broadway, and a lot of the paired boards. The \none difference that we can see is that, even on the double broadway \nboards, when there is a flopped straight possible, we have to do much \nmore checking. The trend is becoming increasingly clear for both IP \nand OOP deepstack strategy; when our range is more vulnerable \nbecause of the connectivity of the board, we up our checking \nfrequencies significantly. Again, really important we don\u2019t religiously \nfollow the solver here on a board like QT8, KJ9 etc. We want to bet \nwider than the solver suggests, but we cannot bet anywhere near as \nwide as we can on a board like KJ6 or AK8. \n\nIf we take a look now at the middling/low textures, this is very similar \nto when we are IP, and we must play these boards much more \nconservatively. One thing that is completely different is our sizing \nscheme; at 200bb and below we are using a 75% cbet size, but at the \ndeeper 300bb+ stack depths the solver very clearly prefers using a \nsmaller bet size on these textures. I think this will be down to being \n\n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nOOP on connected boards that can change quickly on a variety of \nturns, the solver wants to keep the pot size small OOP. \n\n200bb and below, we use a larger cbet on these lower/connected \nboards, but when deeper we actually prefer using a smaller bet size! \n\nButton Straddle Games \n\nI often get asked if straddling the button at every opportunity is +EV \non a softer table. Whilst there is the benefit of being in position vs a \ntable of weaker players, I am very much of the opinion that it is not \n+EV to straddle the BTN at every opportunity. If you are playing 2/5 \nyou have to put in $7 every orbit for your blinds, and if you are \nstraddling the BTN at every opportunity you have to put in $17 every \norbit. This just doesn\u2019t make it worthwhile. \n\nI am a big fan of straddling and getting people out of their comfort \nzones, but it is absolutely essential that we are not the only person \nstraddling (whether BTN or UTG). Only straddle if the whole table is \ndoing it. You can make a very rare exception for doing it once or twice \nif you have a very active fun player that you want to show you aren\u2019t a \nnit, or if they are straddling and you don\u2019t want them to feel tilted that \nnobody else is. Top tip \u2013 announce it loudly to the dealer so they see \nit! \n\nIn terms of playing against a button straddle, this is a very important \ntopic and one that I think a lot of people make big mistakes in. Firstly \nlet\u2019s discuss playing from the blinds. It is extremely important that we \ndon\u2019t \u2018complete\u2019 too wide from the blinds, as we have 6 or 7 players \nbehind us who can raise and make our lives a misery. We want to \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\ncomplete from the blinds with hands that can continue vs an open. \nLet\u2019s take a look at what that range should look like. \n\nWhen it comes to what our opening range should look like, we must \nremember that 1) we will be OOP vs the BTN very often, and 2) the \neffective stacks for everyone has just halved, so we must realise that \nwe are playing shallower and open less as a result. As we\u2019ve seen in \nthis module so far, we must be really tight from early position, and \nthis rings doubly true when the BTN straddle is on. We can widen our \nrange in later position, but even if it folds to us in HJ/CO, we still want \nto select hands that will play well OOP when BTN defends (which they \nwill do around 75% of the time). Hands like A6o, K5o, 85s etc will be \nunprofitable opens, and we should aim to choose hands that are \nsuited/more connected for better playability postflop OOP. \n\nIsolating Limpers \n\nThe golden rule of isolating limpers is to ask yourself \u201cwould I open \nthis hand if the action had folded to me?\u201d If the answer is yes, we can \nisolate. Again if we refer to our opening charts for certain positions, \nwe can see what hands we should be isolating with. \n\nWhile this above rule is very effective, it doesn\u2019t apply to CO/BTN/SB; \nwe cannot isolate hands like K8o, A6o etc that we would open on the \nBTN. We can apply our HJ opening range when we are in CO/BTN/SB \nand isolate this range instead. \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nOur isolating size is dependent on 1) how many limpers there are, and \n2) the stack size of the limpers. On average we want to raise to around \n5x when IP and 6x when OOP. If that feels bigger than usual to you, \nplease remember that limpers are generally weaker players, and we \nare more than happy to bloat the pot vs their weaker range with our \nstronger range. If players are limping from shorter stacks, we can \nlower our isolating size to 3.5-4bb. There is no set formula for raise \nsize vs number of limpers, but we can use a loose rule of 1 extra BB \nper limper. Vs 1 limp we would raise to 5x IP, vs 2 limps we would \nraise to 6x, and so on. In the rare instance there are 6 or 7 limps, we \nwould cap our raise size at around 8bb, anything bigger just seems \nunnecessary. \n\nOverlimping \n\nIt is extremely important that we don\u2019t overlimp too wide in raked \ngames. As we have seen from the opening charts, we really do need \nto be quite tight overall, particularly in these SRP/limped pots. We \nwant to overlimp hands that can flop extremely well. Hands like \nA2s/A3s/22-66 are great candidates to overlimp with; they can flop \nextremely well, and our low wheel suited aces get to flush-over-flush \npeople. Hands like 97s, A5o, K4s etc might seem appealable to \noverlimp, but the reality is that they are often dominated, and we \nshould remain disciplined and fold these types of hands. Overlimping \nis something that we don\u2019t do very often at all, but it is important to \nhave a feel for the correct types of hands that we would want to do \nthis with. Remember, tight is right! \n\n  \n  \n \n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nLive heuristics and dynamics (a lot or most of this is about recs): \n\n-down or up players tend to bluff a little more or thin value bet more. when down, they want to \nbluff or thin value to get back up. when up, they are okay with variance sometimes for bluffing \nmore. \n\n-with multiway pots need better hands to value. top pair becomes not nearly as good in \nmultiway, so need stronger hands to be betting versus HU. \n\n-^ in concession w this, you can and should fold better hands in multiway vs heads up as is \nmore likely your behind. \n\n-getting recs to show hand: make dynamic to show each other hands if you think it gives you \nmore advantage then him. also, talking about the hands makes the recs want to show more bc \nthey love talking about hands. don\u2019t be predatory tho and just like ask to see hand straight up, \nthat can be cold if just trying and trying hard and not good. basically just be cool about it and \ntreat them like people. \n\n^like what steve kurton did first poker tourney. \n\nfor against bad wide rec preflop cold callers (advice is about what to do post flop): \n\n- check more and make them make mistakes. ex: check oop,and they will almost always bet all \ntop pairs and best under pairs, so if they check back you know they aren\u2019t protecting checking \nrange enough so more likely a weak range. also, check raise mroe with value hands bc they \nprolly call w hands they stabbed with **can do this bc these rec people see a check and think \nweakness so they bet more marginal hands and almost all top pairs** \n\n^if you want to bluff people like this, do when they checked back bc checking range is so weak. \nand will likely call w stabbing range since they mostly stab equity and great draws. \n\n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\ngeneralization ^^. start conservitaly and bluff high equity hands, but if you see a low top pair \nstabbing it semi confirms this \n\n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nlater street rec/fish aggressjon a lot of times they actually have it, however this is way too \ngeneral \n\nlower level players call too much / get sticky so can exploitably under bluff. since they are \nincapable of making big folds can exploitable under bluff. \n\nin simplistic sense, recs put more money in when they are not good and call bets and raises w \nhands that are average.  \n\nthere are spots/reads w board or player that are clear underbluffs or bluffs for specific reasons. \nthere are also grey areas where you are unsure if bluffs r good in the spot, and in these grey \nareas we  should tend to not bluff.  \n\n^for recs \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nrandom live wisdom tips: \n\n-  be thinking about why your making any bet/bet size at any point and what your \ntrying to accomplish, like what parts of their range your targeting w bet/betsize \n(either to get folded or to get calls from or things like that), how population \ntendencies work in this situation, etc.  \nthink what can i do to make them make a mistake, and what\u2019s the mistake he is \ngonna make.

I have used PokerStars as \nan example of how the rake compares at different stakes. \n\nLet\u2019s start with the higher stakes. Assuming we are playing 6 handed games, if we look at \n1/2, we can see that the rake is capped at less than 1.5bb per pot. If we look at 25nl, we \ncan see the rake is capped at 8bb per pot. If we look at 5nl, we can see that the rake is \ncapped at 20bb per pot. This tells us that the lower stakes we play, the higher the rake is, \nand we need to make significant adjustments as a result. Naturally there are many plays \nthat we can make that are very high in EV, but there are certain plays that will be very \nmarginal in terms of their EV, and the higher rake structure then starts to make some of \nthese plays lower EV. It is extremely important that we are mindful of the rake, and just \nhow significant it is at lower stakes. Please note that the preflop charts I am using are \ndesigned for a 500nl rake structure. \n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s talk about how we can adjust to the higher rake structures. I am \ngoing to break this section down into two different parts. The first part will be about \nflatting preflop on the button, and the second will be about playing out the big blind. \n\nOn the button \u2013 as we all know, we don\u2019t want to have a flatting range when we are in MP, \nCO or SB. There is actually one scenario where we can have some flats in these \n\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\npositions, and that is when we have an absolute maniac behind who we really want to \nplay pots with, and even then it\u2019s a pretty narrow flatting range. I am not talking about \nstandard recs, or even splashy recs, I\u2019m talking about those once-every-few-months \nmaniacs, and even then our flatting range is hands like 88, 99, AQo type hands. Coming \nback to looking at flatting on the button, we are going to use a couple of different charts \nand look at what hands the solver wants to flat vs each position. As we can see from BTN \nvs UTG, the solver will have some low frequency flats with hands like 22-55, 54s, 65s and \nAJo. These hands need to be taken out of our flatting range at 50nl and below. These \nvery marginal calls will get eaten up by the rake, particularly the dominated hands like \n65s and K9s. If we take a look at BTN vs CO, we will see that our range of course gets a \nlittle wider. We now have hands like T8s and A2s to go along with our 65s, 22, J9s type \nhands. Again, we want to trim off the lower parts that are usually very marginal calls at \nbest. Naturally as our opponent\u2019s opening range gets wider, our range also gets wider, \nwhich is why we see us VPIP a hand like ATo vs CO but not vs UTG. \n\nYou might be asking yourself \u201ccan we simplify our strategy, and just play 3bet or fold on \nthe button given the rake\u201d, and that\u2019s a question that some people think the answer to is \n\u2018yes\u2019, however even in the higher rake structure I still think we want to have some flats on \nthe button. The reason people want to simply play 3bet or fold is to win the pot preflop \nmore often and therefore pay no rake in that pot, which is obviously a sound reasoning, \nbut I think that playing single raised pots in position is going to be still very profitable, \nproviding it\u2019s done with the correct range. My advice is to trim off the marginal calls, up \nour 3bet frequency with the KQs, JJ, AJs type hands, but still call them at a low \nfrequency because of how well they play postflop. Case and point, a reg opens in the CO \nwith KJo, and you have KQs on the button. If you 3bet, you force your opponent to fold \ntheir hand, but for the times it comes down K83r it\u2019s still worth having that flatting range. \nA hand like T8s, however, is going to be more dominated and less appealable to flat, and \nTHEN you factor in the rake on top, it then makes more sense to 3b this hand the same \namount our charts suggest, but then folding the rest of the time instead of calling. \n\nSummary \u2013 ditch the marginal flats on the button, up your 3bet frequencies with hands \nthat are mixing between 3b and call, and still call at a low frequency with certain hands \nthat have your opponent often dominated preflop. A perfect example, CO vs BTN, our \ncharts say 3bet AJs and KQs 50%, I would up my frequencies to 75% 3bet, and 25% call. \nOne last point that is really important, it\u2019s impossible to memorise your charts and your \nfrequencies, so when studying for preflop strategies, simply do your best to have a solid \ngrasp on how often you want to 3b certain types of hands as well as calling them, and up \nyour 3b frequencies slightly. \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nDefending the big blind \u2013 I firstly want to talk about defending the big blind in general. \nSimilarly to the above, we simply want to trim off the bottom parts of our defending \nrange. If we look at BB vs UTG (which is actually surprisingly quite wide anyway), we can \nsee that we want to defend hands like 42s, J5s, 84s, A9o and T9o. At 200nl and above, \nthese are of course fine, but defending these at 25nl for example will be haemorrhaging \nmoney. Again just to reiterate the point, if UTG opens to 2.2bb, and you are the only \ncaller, there should be 4.9bb in the middle. At 200nl, more of that 4.9bb pot will still be in \nthe middle after rake is taken out, but at 25nl much more of that pot will already be gone \ndue to the rake. As one very quick sidenote for those of us watching, it goes without \nsaying that in live poker the exact same rule applies. If you are playing a timed game you \nget to defend EXTREMELY wide, but if you are playing 2/5 for example, then you\u2019ve just \ngot to play so much tighter than you might realise when it comes to defending the big \nblind. \n\nIf we look at BB vs BTN now, we again see an understandably very wide range that wants \nto defend. Again, in a higher rake environment, we just can\u2019t defend as wide as this. \nHands like 76o, A3o, 93s, 52s etc become very clear folds. The next point is really quite \nimportant, and will hopefully help you determine just how much tighter you have to play \nfrom the BB\u2026 \n\nWhen we are looking at a more narrow range like BTN flat vs UTG open, we want to trim \noff a small amount of that range. When, however, we are looking at a really wide range \nlike BB vs BTN defend, we trim off a much bigger part of that range. \n\nThe next two parts of this module are no longer about the rake per se, but what we are \nabout to look at will fortunately also help us avoid paying unnecessary rake. \n\nCalling too much in the BB multiway \n\nI have managed to secure some multiway preflop defending ranges for the purpose of \nthis module. Again, these are rake adjusted for 500nl, but even without that fact, I\u2019m \nreally hopeful that these will be quite eye opening in terms of just how much tighter we \nshould be when calling multiway out of the big blind. Our first example is UTG opens to \n2.2BB, BTN calls, and we are defending out of the big blind. Let\u2019s firstly take a look at \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nsome of the hands that just aren\u2019t in there/aren\u2019t pure calls. ATo and KTo are pure folds, \nQTo and QJo are only in there sometimes, and hands like Q2s, J7s, 84s and 32s are just \nnever/rarely in there. It is EXTREMELY important that we don\u2019t just shrug our shoulders, \nand click call with hands like this because we think we are priced in or that we\u2019re closing \nthe action so we can call really wide. How dominated our hand is far outweighs the price \nwe are getting or anything else for that matter. It\u2019s also really important to understand \nthat when there are more players in the pot, the equity of our hand goes down and \ntherefore we\u2019re going to be doing more poorly postflop. Factor in a higher rake \nenvironment at the micros and we can clearly see that a lot of us are calling way too wide \nmultiway out of the big blind (myself included!). Again, if we change this to look at CO \nopen, BTN call and what our defending range looks like, we see that it is not very wide at \nall, 16.28% in fact. Just look at all these suited hands that you might think are calls (85s, \nJ2s, 74s, 32s etc), along with the fact that the solver is MIXING with QJo/JTo etc. I really \ndo think this will be eye opening to a lot of us, and we can now start to drastically tighten \nup our calling ranges out of the big blind multiway. I think it\u2019s also important to say that \nthis isn\u2019t a spot you can really study and nail down your ranges/frequencies on, so the \nmain point of this subsection is too simply advise you to be more mindful of how much \nwe might need to tighten up from the big blind multiway. \n\nCalling too much in the BB with hands that should be 3bets \n\nWhen asked to make this module, this was the very first thing that sprung to mind. It is \nsuch a common leak, and one that all lower stakes players have. It is extremely easy to \nthink that you know your preflop charts and you are 3betting well from the big blind, but \nthe reality is you are almost certainly not 3betting enough. You can check this right now \nin your tracking software by filtering for your 3bet stat BB vs UTG, MP, CO, BTN, and SB. \nIt should be approximately as follows\u2026 \n\nBB vs UTG \u2013 6% \n\nBB vs MP \u2013 7.8% \n\nBB vs CO \u2013 10.2% \n\nBB vs BTN \u2013 14.9% \n\nBB vs SB \u2013 19% \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nI want to look at three different preflop charts to signify where the leaks arise. \n\nBB vs UTG \u2013 we can see that our 3betting range isn\u2019t that wide, and therefore the reason I \nhave chosen this chart is a reminder that we want to 3bet hands like 76s, Q9s, A2s at \nsome frequency. It\u2019s easy to just click the call button, but these hands play well as a 3bet \nand that\u2019s why they are in there. This is another nice way for us to not pay any rake, by \nensuring we are 3betting correctly from the BB with these infrequent hands and taking \nthe pot down pre more often. Be sure that you are mindful of these hands that want to \n3bet and aren\u2019t just always calling them. \n\nBB vs BTN \u2013 similar to the above, there are a lot of hands like 54s and A2s type hands \nthat we need to be mindful to 3bet at some frequency with, but the wider the opening \nrange, the more extravagant hands we have in our range that will for sure be slipping \nsome of our minds. As we can see from BB vs BTN, we should now be 3betting hands \nlike J7s, ATo, 64s, Q8s and K6s. It\u2019s really important to remember that these hands are \n3bets at some frequency because that is a higher EV option than just calling, so if we are \ncurrently not 3betting these hands then we are costing ourselves EV. \n\nBB vs SB \u2013 taking it one step further from the above range, we can see that BB vs SB is \njust a whole other animal itself. Not only are we in position, but the SB is opening \nextremely wide, and we can deny so much equity by following this 3bet chart as closely \nas we can. For example, think of all the ace highs that the SB opens that they have to fold \nwhen we 3bet our K6o. It\u2019s a very wide 3b range, and of course the most polarised range \nthat we will see, but it\u2019s just so important to find these T7o, T2s, A2o, K5o type hands at \nsome frequency instead of just always calling them, and that\u2019s before we even consider \nthe higher rake structure! \n\nCbetting too much as the preflop aggressor \n\nI want to look at several different scenarios as the preflop aggressor where I feel like \nplayers cbet too much. Generally at lower stakes you want to be cbetting a little wider \n(particularly when in position), as you will be faced with less raises, and therefore you \nget to realise your equity/make people fold on the turn more often. There are, however, \nmany scenarios where we do want to be checking at a higher frequency than people \nrealise, and we can increase our EV by mixing in more checks in certain scenarios. It\u2019s \nreally important that we understand that the upcoming material is not focusing on \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nstudying the particular scenarios, but focusing more on the reasons we are checking \nmore frequently, and how we can apply that line of thinking to our own game. \n\nSB vs BB SRP \u2013 one of my previous modules focused on playing SRPs out of position vs \nthe button, so I\u2019m not going to select an example from that part of the game tree because \nthere\u2019s already plenty of content out there on that subject. SB vs BB however we are \ngoing to see an eye opening number of different boards that we are checking so much \non. If we look at our SB vs BB spreadsheet we can quickly identify the types of boards \nwe get to cbet extremely wide on. These two parts are really key to determining what \ntypes of boards we cbet less frequently on when OOP: 1) how good the board is for our \nrange, and 2) how much resistance we will bet met with when cbetting. \n\nA perfect example of this is K76r and Q72r. They are both single broadway boards that \nare similar in terms of how good they are for us, but we can see that we cbet so much \nless often on K76 than we do on Q72. The reason for this is that on Q72 our opponent \ncan\u2019t continue with so many 85s, 84s, 98o etc type hands, but of course on K76, our cbet \nsuccess rate is lower, and therefore we can\u2019t cbet as wide. An even further example of \nthis is evident on the lower textures. Boards like 763 are virtually pure checks. This is a \ncombination of the two points above. It\u2019s nowhere near as good a board for us as KJ4r, \nand our cbet is much less likely to be successful, so our range is forced into checking. \n\nComing back to the overall purpose of this module, and the answer to the question of \n\u201cwhat mistake do you regularly see people make as a coach?\u201d is that people cbet too \nmuch OOP, and don\u2019t recognise situations where they should be checking at a higher \nfrequency than they currently are. When we are OOP, we are more likely to be floated, \nand if we are betting too wide, our range is too wide on the turn, and we end up check \nfolding way too much. Let\u2019s protect our range by upping our checks with the right type of \nhands. \n\nBoards that are really bad for our range \u2013 I\u2019m going to use some very extreme but also \nvery eye opening examples for this subsection. Let\u2019s say we are UTG and we open. The \nbig blind defends, and we go heads up to 543r. The big blind checks. We have some \nstrong hands here. We have 76s, 55, 44 and 33 at some frequency. You\u2019d be completely \nforgiven for initially thinking that we cbet all those hands at a very high frequency, \nhowever if we take a look at the solver, we can actually see that we are checking back \nvirtually our entire range on this flop. We can compare this to 643fd to see a very clear \ntrend here: on these lower/middling boards that are extremely connected, we want to be \ndoing very little cbetting overall (and on the REALLY low/connected boards we can see \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nthat we don\u2019t do any cbetting at all). It\u2019s important to understand why we aren\u2019t cbetting \nthat much here, and the reason is something we call \u2018range composition\u2019. If we look at \nthe BB\u2019s range, we can see that the BB has 42s, 74s, 53s, 63s that EP doesn\u2019t have, along \nwith sets/2p at a much higher frequency. Whilst BB\u2019s overall equity is doing okay on this \nboard, we just have so few nutted hands here, and therefore our range can\u2019t justify \ncbetting very often at all, and we are forced to do so much checking back. If we look at a \nless extreme example of T97fd, we see a higher frequency cbet, but still a very low \noverall cbet frequency. \n\nLet\u2019s change the scenario now to CO vs BB (note that I have changed the cbet size from \n50% to 71%). We can look at a few different boards and see that there is a very similar \ntrend going on here. It\u2019s not as extreme as EP vs BB, but our cbet frequencies are still \nVERY low on so many boards. This confirms to us that this is not just an EP/MP vs BB \nthing, it\u2019s very much a trend that we need to incorporate into our strategy across the \nboard. \n\nAgain, if we ask the question of \u201cwhat mistake do you see regularly as a coach?\u201d, the \nanswer here is clearly that there are so many different types of boards that people are \ncbetting WAY too wide on, and again our checking frequencies as the preflop aggressor \nneed to increase. Hopefully we now have a better grasp of the types of boards we want to \nbe checking more often on, and why. My advice going forward would be to take a longer \nlook at those types of boards, and the range that wants to bet/check on them. \n\nCalling too many cbets instead of raising \u2013 I am going to re-visit some previous module \nwork now and look at our BB strategy when facing a cbet. Instead of typing out a few \nparagraphs here, we are going to look at two or three different boards and familiarise \nourselves with our raising range from the BB when facing a cbet. I have chosen BTN vs \nBB for this part as both ranges are really wide. \n\nQ75r \n\nTT2r \n\n952fd \n\nK83r \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nTURN \n\nUsing non overbet sizes \u2013 this is again a really common leak in beginners that I see as a \ncoach when it comes to turn play. It\u2019s something that can be easily rectified by \nrecognising scenarios where we want to be very polarised with our turn size. Let\u2019s take a \nlook at a few different boards and see just how polarised the solver wants to be in certain \nspots. \n\nK94r BTN vs BB \u2013 before we look at our turn strategy, it\u2019s important to note that on this \nflop we are betting 88% of our range (and of course can simplify and bet our entire \nrange). Our opponent is folding approximately 34% of their range, which means that IP \narrives to the turn with a wider range with more air in it, and OOP\u2019s range has less air, is \nmore condensed and is therefore doing well on so many turns. We can see this when we \nlook at the equity throughout each action leading up to the turn. This is important \nbecause it helps us to understand why we generally favour overbet sizes. We can look at \nall the turn cards at once and see that we aren\u2019t doing much betting overall when we get \nto the turn, and our sizing scheme reflects this. \n\nT62r BTN vs BB \u2013 we are going to compare this board with a few different boards, all of \nwhich use a larger cbet size on the flop and bet less frequently than the K94r we have \njust looked at. We\u2019ll see a few different anomalies in our turn strategy (and these \nanomalies identify the difficulty/frustration that we can all relate to when it comes to \nsolver work). As we can see on T62r, we want to overbet the overcards up to the king. As \nwe can see on 732fd, we want to overbet the 8x and 9x turns, but use a standard 75% bet \nsize on the broadway turns. If we look at T42fd we can see that it\u2019s quite similar to the \nT62r, and then if we look at 954r we will see it is similar to 732fd. The mistake I see here \nas a coach is that there are clearly some spots where we want to play overbets on \novercard turns, but a lot of the time people don\u2019t tend to find these overbets. We want to \nkeep our strategy nice and simple and use an overbet size on the overcards on T high \nflops, but on the 8 high flops for example, it\u2019s only the 9x and Tx that we find the overbet \non. It\u2019s really important to find these overbets, and the reason why lies in how much the \nOOP player must fold. Please note that we wouldn\u2019t overbet on a straight completing \novercard (like T92Q), and that we still overbet on brick turns (like T923). \n\nChecking too much with non-equity turn barrels \u2013 this is without a doubt the hardest part \nof this module to master, and one that you must study in depth/be comfortable with \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nbefore implementing. The \u201cnon equity\u201d turn barrel range doesn\u2019t need to be particularly \nvast, and mainly centres around your blockers. Gone are the days when you barrel the \nturn with equity only. Let\u2019s take a look at a couple of different boards, both SRPs and \n3BPs. \n\nQ84r SRP BTN vs BB \u2013 BTN opens, and cbets basically their entire range on this flop. On \nthis 2x turn, we clearly have some equity barrels like A5, A3, JT and 65. We can also \nclearly see that we have some barrels in there that are not a straight/flush draw, and we \nclass these as \u201cno equity barrels\u201d. As we can see, the range doesn\u2019t have to be \nparticularly wide, and it centres round our blockers/unblockers. For example, our no \nequity turn barrels almost never contain an ace in this spot, because an ace blocks a lot \nof the hands we are trying to make fold (think of all the Ax that float the flop from OOP). \nWe use these K6s/K5s type hands because they have an overcard, which gives us 3 \nclean outs vs a hand like QJo for example, but we\u2019ll also find some J7s/J6s type hands in \nthere as well, and that\u2019s because the J blocks QJ, and the 5/6/7 kicker don\u2019t block too \nmany hands we are trying to make fold. We can sum this up really nicely by saying that a \nhand like T9s has more equity than K5s, but T9s blocks so many J9o, T9o, KTo type calls \nthat OOP has, whereas K5s unblocks more hands that we\u2019re trying to make fold. \n\nA82r BB vs SB 3BP \u2013 I want us to look at the 5h turn here for a very nice insight into our \nturn barrelling range. We have plenty of hands here that pick up a flush draw/gutshot that \nwant to keep barrelling, but let\u2019s take a look at our JTs/QJs type hands. These hands \nblock our opponent\u2019s best top pairs, and if we force the solver to bet the turn and shove \nthe river for IP, we can see these combos blast off very often, and what\u2019s more interesting \nis if we look at OOPs reaction to a triple barrel. We can see OOP calling the river with \nAQ/AJ, and folding AT/A9/some weaker Ax at some frequency. This means that QJ/JT \nblock our opponent\u2019s best hands to call with, which is a perfect example of a turn/river \nbarrel with no equity, that instead focuses on blockers! \n\nKK6r BTN vs CO 3BP \u2013 once again I want to take a very quick look at our turn barrelling \nrange here for IP. We bet our entire range on the flop, and if we really focus on our turn \nbarrelling combos on a 4d turn, we will see such a nice insight into our \nblockers/unblockers theory. Let\u2019s start with our AQs combos. We continue to barrel \nAQdd because we\u2019ve picked up equity, and we continue to barrel AQhh because AQhh \ndoesn\u2019t block hands like AJss/ATcc that float the flop and then have to fold the turn. \nAgain, our unblockers are extremely good here with AQhh. Let\u2019s now look at our QJs \ncombos. Again, we bet QJdd because we have picked up a flush draw, but we can also \nbet our QJhh/QJcc combos, and this is because if we look at the Kx cards on the flop, \nQJhh/QJcc block KQs/KJs best, and they make it into our turn barrelling range. QJss has \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nnot picked up any equity, and also has really bad blockers, so we bet this way less often. \nIf we change the turn to the 4h, we can see that QJss/QJdd become lower frequency turn \nbarrels, but QJhh/QJcc are always betting, and this is to do with our blockers. Two really \nawesome examples here of our unblockers, and our blockers for no equity turn barrels! \n\nBarrelling too much in 3b pots OOP with strong hands \n\nA really fun topic for us to look at now, and one that is again really important/a big leak \nthat we can plug. We\u2019re going to look at SB vs BTN on a few different boards, and focus \nmainly on our value hands here. \n\nQ72r \u2013 first thing\u2019s first, let\u2019s look at all the turn cards and the difference in our barrelling \nfrequencies. If we look at the equity our range has on each turn card, we can see that the \nlower cards are really not as good for us as the higher cards, and our betting frequency \nshould reflect that. The reason for this is that we are betting our entire range on the flop, \nand our opponent folds out their air/marginal hands, so we arrive to the turn with a super \nwide range, and IP\u2019s range is condensed into stronger hands. So with that in mind, let\u2019s \ntake a look at our strategy on these lower turn cards. On the 4c, for example, we have so \nmuch air that wants to just give up that we must protect our checking range with some \nstrong hands. We protect that range with our weaker top pairs like Q9s that want to \ncheck/call turn and check/call river, and we also have some really strong hands that like \nto check/shove. AQs, AQo and AA without a club are basically always check/jamming \nwhen they do check. \n\nIf we come back to the original question asked in the module, \u201cwhat mistakes do you see \nthat are very common in cash games?\u201d this is very much one of those mistakes. In 3bet \npots OOP we must not barrel super wide on the turns that are really bad for our range, \nand as a results we must protect our checking range with some really strong hands that \nwant to check/jam! \n\n972r \u2013 I have purposefully chosen a different type of board because there is one last \npoint I want to make which is really important. This isn\u2019t so much about us finding \ncheck/jams on the turn, but about the importance of us finding flop checks. The general \ntrend is very similar here in terms of what turns are better or worse for our range, and \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nagain our betting frequencies must reflect this. If we look at the 3h turn here, we will see \nsome checks with our 77/QQ/KK and very often with our AA. It is REALLY important that \nwe find these checks with our strongest hands on a lower board, and the reason for that \nlies in our opponent\u2019s flop calling range. Let\u2019s look at all of these KQss, QJcc, QTdd etc \ntype hands that float the flop. These hands all pick up 0 equity on the turn, and if we are \njust always betting our AA here, our opponent gets to just laugh in our face and fold all \ntheir floats. If we force the solver to check for OOP on the turn, we can see that so many \nof these hands now start to bluff. We want to allow our opponent to start blasting all their \nflop floats! \n\nRiver \n\nChecking too much instead of going for thin value \u2013 this is by far one of the biggest leaks \nthat I see in lower stakes players. I am going to select some examples and show you just \nhow wide the solver wants to bet in certain situations. \n\nQ52r BB vs BTN SRP \u2013 if we force the BTN to cbet the flop, and the turn to go x/x on a \nbricky runout, we will see just how thinly the solver wants to bet for value here. We can \nsee that the solver wants to bet as wide as 3rd pair with no kicker in this specific \nscenario. This is due to just how wide the BTN\u2019s range is, and all the worse hands 3rd \npair can get called by. If we were to look at an EP vs BB scenario, we would see a \nnarrower range betting the river. It\u2019s important that we recognise situations where our \nopponent\u2019s range is very wide, and therefore go for what might be perceived as \u201cthin \nvalue\u201d, especially in these smaller pots. One of the advantages of betting wider in these \nspots (and using a block size in the process) is that people tend to play very poorly vs \nthese river block bets, and we therefore force our opponent into a lot of mistakes. Case \nand point, on Q5272, we can see that when we block the river, our opponent is supposed \nto raise around 20% of the time, but people at lower stakes games will raise here 3 or 4% \nof the time at the very most. So let\u2019s recognise spots where our opponent\u2019s range is very \nwide, they are somewhat capped, they have enough worse hands we can get called by, \nand widen our betting range. \n\nPlaying Your Range Advantage \n\nSay we open the button, the BB calls, and the flop comes down K83r. The BTN has a very \nclear equity advantage on this board, 54.5%. Let's quickly jump ahead and think about \nwho has the nut advantage. What would we consider the nuts on this board? KK, 88, 33, \nK8 & K3. The BTN always has KK and 88, while the BB never has KK and only has 88 \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\naround 50% of the time. That means that despite this being a very good board for the \nBTN (and the BTN holding an equity advantage), there is actually a small nut advantage \nfor the BTN here. 88, 33, K8 & K3 are all split relatively evenly between both players. This \nmeans that the BTN has a significant range advantage, but only a small nut advantage. In \nthese \u201cwide ranges vs wide ranges\u201d spots, that's going to be relatively common; the \npreflop aggressor will hold the range advantage, but only a slight nut advantage. There \nare of course spots where the preflop aggressor will have the equity advantage AND a \nsignificant nut advantage, and we'll get to those in due course. \n\nThe solver will very often use a small size alongside that equity advantage to put the \nother player's range into an uncomfortable spot. We do this very often as the preflop \naggressor, spots like the above K83r are very common, and we'll also see the same in \n3bet pots, spots like K76 BTN vs CO. This time ranges are much narrower than the \nprevious example, and the nutted combos start to become wider. AA or AK wouldn't be \nconsidered a nutted hand in the first example, but in a 3bet pot when the SPR gets lower \nand ranges are narrower, these hands start to be considered extremely strong hands. \n\nLet's look at a third scenario here, one where we are not the preflop aggressor. Say the \nBTN opens, the SB 3bets, and the BTN calls. The flop comes down 752hhs. The SB has \nan ever so slight equity advantage here of 51.2%, but let's look what happens when the \nSB checks. Before the BTN acts, the SB's equity drops down to 48.4%, which means that \nthe BTN now has the equity advantage. On the face of it, it might not look like a \nparticularly huge equity advantage, but given the SB is the preflop aggressor and has all \nthe overpairs in their range, it is actually a little bigger than it initially looks. If we take a \nlook at the BTN's preferred size, we will see that the same logic applies in this spot as \nwhen the BTN cbets really wide on K83r; the BTN here likes to use smaller sizes, and \nbets very wide. \n\nThis is because it can force a lot of the SB's range into an uncomfortable spot with this \nsmall size, folding out 25% of the SB's range, and forcing them to make some very \nmarginal/breakeven/even some ever so slightly losing calls with hands like KJcc. We can \nalso see that the solver check/calls with K6cc (no backdoor flush) in theory, and in reality \nnobody is doing that, so our small bets are going to be even more effective than this. \n\nLet's look at one last scenario. Say MP opens, the BTN calls, everyone else folds, and the \nflop is 843r. MP is opening approximately 22% of hands, and the BTN is calling \napproximately 6% of hands. This means that MP's range has got lots of air on a board \nlike this, and the BTN's condensed flatting range is doing quite well. If we look at the \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nequities, we can see that the BTN has 53.9% equity. If we look at the BTN's betting \nstrategy, we can see the same trend as the previous three examples. We can also take a \nlook in the reports tab to see the very obvious trend of stabbing much less frequently \n(and for a larger size) on the higher boards. \n\nWhen we hold an equity advantage we want to press that equity advantage by betting \nfrequently for a small size, even if we do not have a significant nut advantage! \n\nIn the first two examples we were betting our entire range. Let's take a look at our betting \nrange in the other two examples where we weren't quite betting our entire range. As we \ncan see, we get to bet very wide, and we get to choose a ton of lower equity bluffs. We \nget to do both of these things because of our equity advantage, and the fact that we are \nin position. Unlike the first two examples, however, we cannot simply bet our entire \nrange. This is because in both examples the OOP player is playing a high frequency \ncheck strategy, and whilst their range is at an equity disadvantage here, they are \nuncapped, and we simply cannot bet our entire range into an uncapped range that still \ncontains lots of strong hands. \n\nWhen we are the preflop aggressor, if we hold an equity advantage and have a middling \nnut advantage, we can bet extremely wide for a small size. When we are the preflop caller \nand have an equity advantage, we get to stab wide for a small size, but cannot bet our \nentire range. \n\nWhen our global frequency is high, we get to find more low/non equity bluffs. When our \nglobal frequency is low, our bluffs really centre around equity! \n\nPlaying Your Nut Advantage \n\nWe have seen some scenarios where one player has a range advantage, but not a \nsignificant nut advantage. We are now going to look at a variety of scenarios where there \nis a significant nut advantage, and understand how it alters our strategy. Gone are the \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\ndays where we automatically check to the aggressor on the previous street, we need to \nbe really mindful of things like equity shifts and nut advantage and apply it to our game! \n\nPlaying your Nut Advantage as the Preflop Raiser in SRPs \u2013 we've taken a look already in \nthis module at boards like K83 where the nut advantage is middling/slightly favourable \nfor the preflop aggressor. Let's take a look now at some boards where the nut advantage \nis very obvious. Let's look at BTN vs BB SRP, and compare the difference between how \nwe play A75 and AK6. On A75, the BTN's nut advantage is middling as the BB has A5o, \nA7o, A7s, 75s, 55 & 77. On AK6, however, the BB has A6, K6 and 66, but the BTN has all \nof the AA/KK/AK combos that the BB just never has. This means that the BTN has a \nsignificant nut advantage on this board. \n\nThe way the solver approaches this spot is very interesting; it likes to press its nut \nadvantage by using very large bets. We can clearly see that it never bets 33%, 50%, or \neven 75% for that matter. It is actually favouring using an overbet here. Before we talk \nabout why that is, let's take a look at the reports tab and compare AK6 to similar types of \nboards. If we scroll through the ace high boards we see the solver favouring 33% as a \ncbet size until we get to ATx, where it CLEARLY prefers using the overbet size. \n\nAnother very telling piece of information that we have here is that there are some Ax \ndouble broadway boards where we aren't using overbet only, and those are monotone \nflops, paired boards, and boards with a flopped straight possible. We do not hold a \nsignificant nut advantage on AJJ, or AK8hhh, or AQT, and the fact that the solver doesn't \nuse overbet only on those three boards tells us one very important thing \u2013 the solver is \nusing the overbet size because of the significant nut advantage that it holds on those \nboards. \n\nBefore we talk about why the solver is bombing it here, let's change the positions to see \nif the solver is consistent with this sizing scheme. Let's change the open position to the \nHJ. Again, if we look at the Ax double broadway boards we can see a similar trend, but \nnot an exact replica of the BTN's strategy. The BTN was very clearly favouring an overbet \nonly size, but on ATx and AJx boards, the HJ is sort of mixing between a variety of bigger \nsizes (quick side note \u2013 we are never going to be splitting between four sizes here, so \nwhilst GTOWizard is a handy tool for a general overview, PIO will always be king as you \nget to mirror your exact strategy). If we look at AQx and AKx boards, we see once again \nreally favouring the big size, especially on AKx boards. The difference between AJ4 and \nAK6 is clear here; because we open in MP, the BB will call way more often with AJ (and \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\neven JJ), but of course the BB will always 3bet with AK and KK, so our nut advantage is \nmuch more significant on AK6. \n\nGiven the holistic nature of this module, I am not going to spend time defining what our \nexact sizes should be, instead we will talk about when to use bigger sizes, and why. We \nhave seen the solver use huge sizes when it holds a significant nut advantage, let's talk \nnow about why that is. Given the nut advantage is so significant, the solver wants to \nhave the ability to play for stacks by the river. If you bet 33% or 50% and overbet the turn, \nyou still can't really shove the river as the SPR is too low. If you overbet the flop and \noverbet the turn, you have set up a reasonable SPR to allow you to press your nut \nadvantage all the way and shove the river. In short, your nut advantage is so significant \nhere that you want to be able to play for all the money, which is a pretty cool concept to \nsee in the solver. \n\nYou might ask yourself, does the same concept apply in a 3bet pot? There are some \ninstances where the solver holds a significant nut advantage and will use big bets in \nsurprising situations, but for the most part we will still be using a smaller cbet size in \n3bet pots. I am not going to write the answer here, but instead invite you to pause the \nmodule and think about why that may be. The hint lies with why the solver wants to bomb \nit on the flop in a single raised pot. \n\nThe way that we press our nut advantage in 3bet pots is to bet extremely wide. We have \nmany examples to choose from, and instead of zoning in on a specific board, let's use \nthe reports tab to look at BTN vs CO in a 3bp on the single/doublebroadway boards. We \ncan clearly see that the solver is betting virtiually its entire range for either a 33% or a \n50% size. \n\nPlaying Your Nut Advantage as the Preflop Caller \u2013 earlier in this video I said \u201cgone are \nthe days where we automatically check to the aggressor on the previous street, we need \nto be really mindful of things like equity shifts and nut advantage and apply it to our \ngame\u201d, and that very much applies to what we are going to look at here. I'm going to \nbreak this down into two subsections... \n\nSRPs \u2013 before we delve into this topic, it's really important for me to say that the limits \nyou are playing will drastically impact our strategy here. Given the difference in rake \nbetween 5nl and 500nl, there are certain hands that we cannot defend in the big blind at \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nlower stakes. GTOWizard don't have reports set up for 50nl rake with a 2.5x open size, so \nI will continue with 500nl rake structure and a minraise. \n\nLet's look at our strategy from the big blind after we have defended vs a HJ open. If we \nuse our reports tab again, the first thing we should notice is that if we are simply always \nchecking to the preflop aggressor, we are costing ourselves some EV. The reports tab \ngives us a very clear overview of where we should be leading (and where we should not \nbe leading). If we look at these lower boards like 654 and 542, we can clearly see that we \nneed to develop a leading strategy on these low boards that we hold a nut advantage on. \nOur overall lead frequency on all of the boards is 2.7%, but if we filter for 8 high and \nbelow, it jumps to 12%. If we filter again for connected boards, it jumps up to 22%. If we \nshould be leading on average 22% of the time on a specific type of board, we are \ndefinitely costing ourselves EV by just checking to our opponent. \n\nIf we look at a board like 653r, we can see that we are very pair heavy with our leads, \nleading our 22, J3, T5s etc at a reasonable frequency. Our natural bluffs are very easy to \nspot, leading with a bunch of 4x and 7x combos. We also get to lead so many hands like \nJ9s and K8s with a BDFD, these hands that have two overs, backdoor draws and minimal \nshowdown are completely fine to lead with, and they will continue to barrel on the turn \nwhen they pick up equity. \n\nMy last piece of advice on this spot is that the solver's leading frequency changes \ndrastically if you change the board ever so slightly. If we look at 632fd for example, we \ncan see that we lead here virtually never, so it is really important that we have a solid \nunderstanding of exactly what boards to lead (and what boards not to lead) before we \nimplement this strategy. Rainbow boards where we hold a significant straight advantage \nwill get lead way more than a board where we don't have a significant straight advantage \nor if there is a FD possible! \n\nBefore we move on to the next subsection, I want to take a look at the same spot for BTN \nvs BB. We have to remember that the BTN's range is going to be wider here, so our lead \nfrequency is going to decrease on certain boards. We still get to lead on boards where \nwe have all the straights, and our opponent has none of the straights, like 653 for \nexample. If we change the board to 864, where we do not have a straight or 2p advantage, \nwe are basically just never leading. We need to REALLY think about the nut advantage in \nthis spot before we can consider leading. If it is significant, we get to lead very wide, if it \nis middling/we do not hold a nut advantage, our lead frequency reduces \ndrastically/becomes non existent! \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\n3bet Pots \u2013 if we choose a couple of different scenarios where we have called a three bet \nout of position, we will see a very clear trend on when to lead out. Let's look at HJ vs CO, \nand we can clearly see that any board that has a three card straight will get lead out on \nextremely often. This is purely down to our nut advantage. If we take 654fd and look at \nthe breakdown of each player's range, we have far more straights         \n, sets and \ntwo pairs than our opponent does. This means that we have a nut advantage, and we \nwant to press that nut advantage. Again, given we have a global frequency of 60.6% here, \nwe get to lead out with tons of hands like KJ and QT because our range can support it. \nIt's really similar to why you get to cbet Q2hh on Kc8s3d BTN vs BB SRP, because your \nrange can support it. \n\nLet's compare this to a board like 743. We have far less flopped straights, no flopped two \npair, and not too many flopped sets here, so our lead frequency goes down significantly. \nOnce again it is very important that we are not leading out at a very high frequency on \nboards that we are not supposed to, and that we have an understanding of what types of \nboards we should lead out on, and the difference between a 765 and a 743. \n\noverbets: \n\n\u25a0  Do NOT overbet on boards that are unfavorable or static paired \n\nboards. \n\n\u25a0  Do NOT overbet in situations where your opponent can \n\nreasonably have many combos of the nuts (or near nuts). \n\n\u25a0  DO overbet on boards that are favorable for you. \n\u25a0  DO overbet on boards where you block the nuts. \n\u25a0  Main overbet situations: \n\n\u25a0  Three flush with the nut flush/nut flush blocker. \n\u25a0  Straight boards when the IP player is barreling and a \nstraight completes that the OOP player can't have. \n\n\u25a0  When preflop range asymmetries allow for \n\noverbetting, such as a QJTxx type board where only \nthe preflop raiser can have AK. \n\n  \n  \n \n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\n\u25a0  We should mainly have two sizes when betting on the river on a 3 \n\nflush board: \n\n\u25a0  1. A \u201cregular\u201d 65-75% pot sizing with our value bets that are \nnot the nuts (with some flushes mixed in order for that range \nto not be vulnerable against check-raises) \n\n\u25a0  2. A big bet size representing the nut flush (maybe the \n\nsecond nuts) or air, usually blocking villain\u2019s nut flush or \nsecond nut flush. \n\n\u25a0  Now let\u2019s revisit the poker math behind the profitability of \n\noverbets. \n\n\u25a0  If we make a pot size bet on the river, we should have two \nvalue bets for each bluff (this calculation is based on pot \nodds \u2192 villain needs to be \u201cright\u201d 33% of the time according \nto pot odds (bet / pot before bet + bet + call) \u2192 we need to be \nbluffing (so he\u2019ll be \u201cright\u201d) 33% of the time \u2192 this way we \nmake him indifferent to calling. \n\n\u25a0  Now let\u2019s look at a hand in which Doug makes a massive 13.5x \npot (yes, you read that right) overbet on the river after checking \nthree times. \n\n\u25a0  In this hand, Doug is playing a little 50/100 heads-up against \n\nSauce123. \n\n\u25a0  Sauce opens to $250 on the BTN and Doug defends \n\nhis BB with A\u2666 2\u2665. \n\n\u25a0  Flop ($500): 5\u2666 9\u2666 6\u2666. Doug checks; Sauce123 checks. \n\u25a0  Turn ($500): J\u2663. Doug checks; Sauce 123 checks. \n\u25a0  River ($500): 3\u2665. Doug checks; Sauce123 bets $353; \n\nDoug raises all-in to $14,348. Sauce123 folds. \n\n\u25a0  Doug chose to show this hand because there is an interesting \n\nconcept to take away from it. \n\n\u25a0  When you are going for these massive overbets, you \ndefinitely want to block the nuts (the nut flush, in this \nhand). However, if you pick all of your A\u2666 hands, you \nwill be severely overbluffing. \n\n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\n\u25a0  Therefore, in order to control your frequencies, you \n\nshould start by raising your A\u2666 with the lowest kicker \n(A2, in this case). \n\n\u25a0  In the hand above, Doug claims to have about 5 \n\ncombinations of value bets. So if he has 4 combos of \nbluff with A\u2666 2x, along with maybe one more (such as \nA\u2666 4\u2660) he will be close to perfectly balanced on the \nriver. \n\n\u25a0  This video featured a particularly interesting hand (@01:29). \n\u25a0  Doug is playing $100/$200 HU with antes against Wilhasha, \n\nwho opens on the BTN and Doug defends on the BB with A\u2665 \n2\u2663. \n\n\u25a0  Flop ($1,080) 8\u2665 2\u2665 T\u2660. Doug checks, Wilhasha bets $646.80, \n\nDoug calls. \n\n\u25a0  Turn ($2,373) 3\u2665. Doug checks, Wilhasha bets $1778.70, Doug \n\ncalls. \n\n\u25a0  River ($5,931) 4\u2663. Doug checks, Willhasha bets $4446, Doug \n\nshoves for $18,813 effective. \n\n\u25a0  On this river, we are looking to call down with our Tx \n\nand our 8x that have strong flush blockers. \n\n\u25a0  Therefore, our bluff raises should be our A\u2665 X hands \n\nthat cannot quite call. \n\n\u25a0  Doug says that hands that work very well as bluffs in \nthis spot are A\u2665 4x, A\u2665 3x, and A\u2665 2x. However, if we \nuse all of these combos, we would already have 9 \ncombos of bluffs for around 4 or 5 nut flushes and 4 \nor 5 combos of the second nut flush. \n\n\u25a0  Therefore, as Doug says, we would probably be \n\noverbluffing if we bluff raise A\u2665 2x every time. That \nbeing said, he also believes that overbluffing on these \nspots can be quite profitable from an exploitative \nstandpoint since many players get scared and fold too \nmuch. \n\n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\n\u25a0  Generally on straight boards, we like to overbet when our \n\nopponents\u2019 range is capped (cannot / are very unlikely to have the \nnuts or other very strong hands given the action). \n\n\u25a0  An important point to remember is that, even though an overbet \nallows us to bluff with more hands, the biggest part of our range \nwill still often want to bet for a regular sizing. \n\n\u25a0  In other words, overbetting allows us to have more bluffs only in \n\ncomparison to when we are value betting for that overbet size. The \nreason for this is that our range features only a small amount of \nhands that are actually willing to play for stacks. As a result of \nthat, we still have to be very selective when picking which hands to \noverbet with (but not overly picky to a point where we are not \nbluffing enough). \n\n\u25a0  A good way to select those bluffs, according to Doug, is to pick the \nnut low hands in your range and use them as an overbet bluff in \norder to fulfill the criteria of having enough bluff combos. \n\n\u25a0  Another very important factor to consider when overbet bluffing \n\n(and bluffing, generally speaking) is our removal. We do not want \nto bluff with hands that block villain\u2019s folding range and we want to \nblock their calling range. \n\n\u25a0  Now let\u2019s take a look at a heads-up hands played between \nDoug and our fellow Upswing coach Daniel \"DANMERR\" \nMerrilees. \n\n\u25a0  They were playing $50/$100. Doug opens to $238 on the \n\nBTN/SB with 5\u2666 3\u2666 and DANMERR calls. \n\n\u25a0  The flop ($476) comes 4\u2660 K\u2660 6\u2663. DANMERR checks, and Doug \nbets $322.32 with this clear Category 3 hand. DANMERR calls. \n\n\u25a0  Turn ($1,120.64) is A\u2665. DANMERR decides to lead small for \n\n$300, Doug raises to 1,881, and DANMERR calls. \n\n\u25a0  River ($4,882.92) is 5\u2663. DANMERR checks, Doug shoves for \n\n19,725, DANMERR calls. \n\n\u25a0  There are three main takeaways from this hand: \n\n\u25a0  1. We need to have two bet sizes on this river. A \n\nregular one for our good-but-not-nutted value bets \n\n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nsuch as two pairs or bottom set, and an overbet one \nwith our nutted hands (namely straights and some \nsets as well). And don\u2019t forget to allocate enough \nbluffs for both of these ranges! \n\n\u25a0  2. When the river is favorable for us, we\u2019re gonna \nbarrel at a much higher frequency given that our \nrange just got much stronger. \n\n\u25a0  3. Carefully take removal effects into account when \n\nchoosing what hands to bluff with. \n\n\u25a0  In this video, Doug reviewed what he describes as a \u201cpretty \n\ncool hand\u201d (@07:50). \n\n\u25a0  The game was $25/$50 HU on PokerStars and he was playing \n\nagainst asianflushie. \n\n\u25a0  Doug opens to $140 on the BTN/SB with A\u2660 J\u2665. Villain calls on \n\nthe BB. \n\n\u25a0  Flop ($280) comes K\u2665 2\u2663 J\u2660. BB checks, Doug checks. \n\u25a0  Turn ($280) is the Q\u2666. BB bets $175. Doug calls. \n\u25a0  River ($630) is the 9\u2660. BB bets $400. Doug goes all in for $4,810 \n\ntotal. \n\n\u25a0  First off, Doug establishes our value in this spot. \n\n\u25a0  He says that we should be going all in with our AT \ncombos (which we should have at a very high \nfrequency after checking the flop) in order to stack \nvillain\u2019s Tx, and that we should mainly raise small \nwhen we have just a Tx hand ourselves. \n\u25a0  Now that we have defined our value, we must find our bluffs. In \nthis spot, we will have to be a bit creative since we will have to \nuse hands that have some showdown value. \n\n\u25a0  Our bluffs will have to come from Jx hands. We would \nbe mainly betting Kx on the flop, and even though we \nare not happy about it, we must call Qx in order to not \noverfold. Now we\u2019re down to our Jx hands, and we \n\n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\ncan fold some of them since we have so many Jx in \nour range after checking the flop (classic Category 2 \nhand). \n\n\u25a0  Therefore, these Jx holdings are close between \n\ncalling or folding, what makes us consider them as \nbluff candidates. After establishing that some Jx must \nbe bluffed, we should think about the removal \nproperties of our bluffs. In that scenario, it would be \nimportant for us to have A in order to block villain\u2019s \nnut combos (AT). Therefore, AJ is one of the best bluff \ncandidates and Doug decides to go for the jam. \n\n In this lesson, Doug will focus on spots where we can put a lot of \npressure with overbets on villains due to the fact that they are capped. \nHe reviewed a hand that perfectly illustrates that scenario starting \n@02:50. \n\n\u25a0  The game is $100/$200 heads-up against Sauce1234. \n\u25a0  Doug raises to $240 on the SB/BTN, and BB calls. \n\u25a0  The flop ($960) comes K\u2666 8\u2665 T\u2660. BB checks, Doug bets $720, \n\nBB calls. \n\n\u25a0  This is a great flop for the preflop raiser. BB should \nnot have any of the sets (maybe only 88 at a small \nfrequency) and only a reduced amount of the two \npairs. Therefore BTN can be very aggressive on such \na board and Doug\u2019s KT is basically the nuts. \n\n\u25a0  Turn ($2400) 5\u2663. BB checks, Doug bets $1,800, BB calls. \n\n\u25a0  This turn is basically a brick, which means Doug can \ncontinue with an aggressive betting strategy. That\u2019s \nwhat he does and let\u2019s take a river. \n\u25a0  River ($6000) is the J\u2665. Now the board is K\u2666 8\u2665 T\u2660 5\u2663 J\u2665. \n\n\u25a0  Even though this might look like a dicey river since \nseveral straights complete, in reality BB should not \nhave many straights at all in this spot (he is capped). \n\n \n  \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nHis AQ would have 3-bet preflop in BB\u2019s shoes; Q9 \nand 97 would have been folded on the turn nearly \nalways; and KJ for the two pairs would have 3-bet \npreflop at a high frequency. \n\n\u25a0  On the other hand, Doug is uncapped as he can easily \nhave all of these nutted hands (with exception of AQ \nthat will check on the flop a decent amount of the \ntime). Clearly a very favorable situation for BTN, who \ncan work in an aggressive strategy with a good \namount of overbetting. \n\n\u25a0  Our bluffs would mainly be missed straight draws \n\nsuch as 96, 76, and 64. \n\n\u25a0  As a final note, Doug reminds us that even though having three \n\nor more bet sizes on certain spots is optimal in theory, we \nshould not try to replicate this strategy in practice as humans \nbecause we would not be able to apply such a complex \nstrategy in a balanced way. Using only a couple of sizes in a \nbalanced and effective manner will be sufficient for us to \nachieve a high level of poker. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\n% above in each line is percent of hands you should jam with!

It helps you know what \nyour chip stack is worth in dollars which helps govern decision making. \n\nIn a cash game, you can quit your session at any time and leave with the \nchips in your stack and trade the for dollars at 1 to 1. In a tournament you \nMUST finish in a certain position, the top ~10-15% of those positions \npaying out. At the end of a tournament someone will win all of the chips, \nbut only 15-25% of all of the money (in most cases). \n\nIf you were to play a $5,000 dollar tournament that started with 5,000 \nchips, you're paying $1 per 1 chip before the first hand is dealt. As the \ntournament rolls on, however, 1 chip stops equaling $1. \n\nThere are a number of factors that impact the real dollar value of your \nstack as it fluctuates: \n\n1.  Your stack size \n2.  The stack of everyone else in the tournament \n3.  The payout structure \n\nTo sum it all up, ICM is the math behind understanding the dollar \nvalue of your chip stack. It's a useful but imperfect estimation based on \na model that determines your likely finishing position. \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nLet's cement your understanding of ICM with two simple examples. \n\nICM Example 1 \n\nTournament buy-in: $1,000 \n\nTotal entrants: 9 \n\nStarting stack: 1000 chips \n\nIn this instance, assuming all players are of equal skill, each player's \nstack is worth $1,000 (1 chip = $1) before the first hand is dealt. Here's a \nscreenshot from an free ICM tool showing this: \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nNow, imagine after several levels of play that 5 players have been \nknocked out and the chip stacks now look like this: \n\n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\n(I'm using ICMIZER's free calculator to evaluate the dollar value of chip \nstacks in these examples. You can find this tool here. Advanced ICM \ncalculations can be done using ICMIZER's premium tool.) \n\nAs you can see, 1 chip no longer equals $1. This brings us to one of the \nfundamental takeaways of ICM... \n\nThe fewer chips you have, the more valuable they are on a per chip \nbasis. Conversely, the more chips you have the less valuable they \nare. \n\nThis happens because of the payout structure. One player has 800 \nchips, but there's no way to win exactly $800 in this tournament. You'll \neither win $5k, $2.5k, $1.5k, or $0. Even 1 chip has some value because \n\n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nyou still have some (albeit very small) chance of cashing for $5k, $2.5k, \nor $1.5k. \n\nAnd this is the point in a tournament where a bubble is introduced. It is \nvery valuable to not bust immediately because, if you were to survive, \nyou increase your expectation. \n\nWhat that means is that losing is asymmetric to winning. In practice, \nthis often leads to less risk taking. \n\nFor example, suppose I\u2019m the player in third place with1900 chips. I\"m \npresented the option to flip a coin for 100 chips, which will leave me with \neither 1800 or 2000 chips. I would strongly prefer to not engage in this \nwager because losing 100 chips is more costly than gaining 100 chips is \nbeneficial. \n\nHere is an example where we win 100 chips vs the short stack at the \ntable: \n\n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nBy winning 100 chips, my third place stack has increased in value by \nabout $92 ($2170 to $2262) \n\nLet's compare that to losing 100 chips to the same player: \n\n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nBy losing 100 chips, my stack has decreased in value by about $94 \n($2170 to $2076) \n\nHere are the results: \n\nAdding an additional 100 chips nets us $92.29 in stack value, whereas \nlosing 100 chips nets us a $93.65 loss. That comes out to a net loss of \n$1.36 dollars. \n\nThis disincentivizes players from taking risks, which has several big \nstrategic implications: \n\n\u25a0  The players with the middling stacks are forced to protect their \nposition and take fewer risks, which is like being strategically \nhandcuffed. \n\n\u25a0  If you have the shortest or the biggest stack, you are at an \n\nadvantage. \n\n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\n\u25a0  Short stacks have the least to lose since their stack is worth \n\nthe least, so they get to play aggressively. \n\n\u25a0  Big stacks can afford to take a hit to their stack, which allows \nthem to leverage their good position to steal pots from the \nother players. \n\nWhich leads me to... \n\nICM Example 2 \n\nHere are the stack sizes and payouts again: \n\nSuppose the blinds are 100/200. \n\n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nThe 2800 stack is in the big blind, the 3500 in the small blind. \n\nAction folds to the 3500 stack who shoves the (on a chip basis i.e. \nchipEV) unexploitable equilibrium range of 46% of hands. That range \nlooks like this: \n\n[22+,A2s+,K3s+,Q4s+,J5s+,T6s+,96s+,85s+,75s+,64s+,54s,A2o+,K6o+,\nQ9o+,J9o+,T8o+,98o] \n\n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\n(I used the SnapShove app to generate these ranges. Hold'em \nResources is another useful tool to find this kind of information.) \n\nAt equilibrium, the 2800 stack in the big blind would call with 28.8% of \nhands: \n\n[22+,A2s+,K7s+,Q9s+,JTs,A2o+,KTo+,QTo+] \n\n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nIn this situation, the big blind is calling 2600 to win 5600. With a quick pot \nodds calculation, you can figure out that means the big blind needs \n46.43% equity to call profitably. \n\nLet\u2019s look at the bottom hands in the big blind's equilibrium calling range \nand see how they are doing vs the shoving range: \n\nA2o has ~47% equity and thus this call (which risks 2600 chips) nets us \n~37 chips on average. \n\nHow much is that worth in dollars? \n\nIf we win, our stack increases in value from $2726 to $3933 (+$1793). \n\n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nAnd if we lose, our stack decreases in value from $2726 to 0 (-$2726). \n\nWhat's the net result of this call with A2o? \n\nAs this quick math shows, making this call and risking our tournament life \nto win 37 chips would be a massive error. When we win, we increase the \nvalue of our stack by $1322.16. When we lose, we decrease the value of \nour stack by $2611.14. \n\n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nWe actually need $(2611.14/($1322.16+$2611.14) = 2611.14/3933.3) \n~66.4% equity vs your opponent's shoving range to call profitably. \n\nIf the SB is aware of this, they are likely to shove 100% of hands. Even \nagainst that range -- literally every possible hand -- A2o is not even close \nto strong enough to call: \n\nIt has just 54.93% equity, well short of the 66.4% we need to call. \n\nWhat about a premium preflop hand like AQs? \n\nEven [AQs] is barely not strong enough. Same with [77] and [AKo]. \n\n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\n(Advanced note: I mentioned in passing earlier that ICM is an imperfect \nmodel. This is because it doesn't account for what poker pros call future \ngame simulations. When you call and double up against the big stack, \nhere, you will be overwhelming chip leader with 4 players left. If that \nhappens, you become the player who gets to play more aggressively and \nsteal pots from your opponents who are trying to survive past the money \nbubble. This increases the expected dollar value of calling with AQs, 77 \nand AKo, and it likely pushes all three hands into profitability.) \n\nThis is a simple and easy example showing what ICM is and how it \nimpacts the optimal strategy. \n\nThe big takeaway for you is this: if you aren\u2019t the biggest or shortest \nstack, you are going to need to play extra conservatively, especially \npreflop. If you are a very large or very short stack, you get to loosen up. \n\n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nThere are two final things to keep in mind: \n\n1.  ICM is most relevant at the final table, the money bubble, \nand before big pay jumps. As you approach a pay jump, it \nplays a bigger role and you need to adjust accordingly. \n2.  It is also important to be aware of whether or not your \n\nopponents are privy to ICM. Many recreational players play \ntournaments and don\u2019t have the slightest clue it exists. Against \nthese players, you will want to be more conservative as they \nwill be playing hands that would otherwise be considered \nspew. Oftentimes you cannot run these players over anywhere \nnear the extent that you would versus a player trying to \npreserve the dollar value of his stack. That said, if you're up \nagainst the guys who are aware of ICM and they have the \nmiddling stacks, you are clear to drop the hammer with \naggressive plays. \n\nPoker Lab Home \n\n\u2190 Previous Lesson \n\nNext Lesson \u2192 \n\nUPSWING POKER \n\u00a9 Copyright 2023 \nSitemap \nResponsible Gambling \n\n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nTerms of Service \nContact \n\nMORE ICM: \n\n \n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\nMistake in tourney: people play too scared later on which affects poorly. This doesnt mean play \nloose, however play normally still having good bluffs. Bluffs even do better when people are \nscared. \n\nCommon mistake with people who do well start and middle but bust out towards final table: they \nplay too tight and bleed almost, need to have preflop shoves to double up if you want to win. \nAnd need to have good and well thought-out postflop shoves as well. Cant be scared!! Cant be \nafraid to shove, its what the winners do. You NEED to as well, you cannot be scared, it just will \nnot work and you will find ylurself losing on bubble or before bubble wayyy too frequently. \n^dont be scared to shove pre, and dont be scared to bluff! \n^^need need need to bluff, cant really underbluff it is just to exploitable with better players. Need \nto bluff like upswing teaches, both pre and post flop!! \n-rly rly rly need to have bluffs. Also need check raise bluffs to balance check raise value and to \nstop others stabs. \n-ILL SAY IT AGAIN- DONT BE SCDARED TO BLUFF on ALL streets, post and pre.

In order to justify \ntheir hand selection, they explain that A3s has good removal \neffect against the top of villain\u2019s range (blocking AA, AK, and \nother strong Ax hands that villains will continue with against \nour 3-bet). \n\n\u25a0  That blocker means we will face slightly more folds and slightly \nless 4-bets when we 3-bet with this hand. As Doug said, this \ndifference might not seem very consequential, but since we \nhave to be selective about the amount of hands that we 3-bet \nas a bluff, it seems reasonable to choose hands that are \nslightly superior candidates over not as good ones. We have to \nkeep in mind that poker is a game of small edges and even a \n1-2% difference in equity will have a huge impact in your \nbottom-line over the long-term. The same reasoning applies to \njustify the next preflop example (KQo - 4:06). \n\n\u25a0  After that, Doug highlights two important questions to consider \n\nwhen we are bluffing on the river: \n\n\u25a0  1. How good is our removal against the top of villain\u2019s \n\nrange? \n\n\u25a0  2. How likely is our hand to win at showdown? \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]\n\n\u25a0  A perfect bluffing candidate is a hand that has good removal \nagainst the top of villain\u2019s range and is not likely to win at \nshowdown. \n\n\u25a0  It is important to note that in preflop situations, we can \n\nsubstitute the showdown value factor for playability (ability to \nrealize equity). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n[Image or diagram may be present here \u2014 check original PDF]", "metadata": {"source": "finalupswing"}}
